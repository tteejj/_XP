# Enhanced NCurses Migration Plan - Complete Guide

## Executive Summary

This enhanced plan transforms the original refactoring proposal into a controlled, verifiable migration with safety mechanisms, validation infrastructure, and optimal LLM workflow integration.

## Key Enhancements Over Original Plan

### 1. **Safety Infrastructure**
- **Checkpoint System**: Save/restore capability at any point
- **Manifest Tracking**: JSON-based state tracking of all components
- **Error Recovery**: Structured error logging with resolution tracking
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick restoration to any previous state

### 2. **Validation Framework**
- **Visual Snapshot Testing**: Capture and compare component output
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure before/after performance
- **Component Testing**: Isolated testing of each component
- **Regression Detection**: Automatic detection of breaking changes

### 3. **Progress Management**
- **Phase Tracking**: Clear indication of current phase
- **Component Status**: Track pending/completed for each file
- **Dependency Management**: Understand component relationships
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Menu-driven migration control

### 4. **LLM Workflow Optimization**

#### Structured Input/Output Format
```powershell
# When you need me to refactor a component, provide:
@{
    Action = "RefactorComponent"
    File = "components/advanced-data-components.psm1"
    Class = "Table"
    CurrentPhase = "phase-1"
    Dependencies = @("layout/panels-class.psm1")
    TestCriteria = @{
        MustRenderBorder = $true
        MustHandleScrolling = $true
        MustSupportSelection = $true
    }
}
```

#### Standardized Response Format
I will respond with:
```powershell
@{
    Status = "Success|Failed|Partial"
    ModifiedFiles = @("file1.psm1", "file2.psm1")
    TestResults = @{...}
    Errors = @(...)
    NextSteps = @(...)
}
```

### 5. **Complete Component Inventory**

The manifest now includes ALL components requiring refactoring:

```json
{
  "core": [
    "modules/tui-engine.psm1",
    "components/tui-primitives.psm1"
  ],
  "panels": [
    "layout/panels-class.psm1"
  ],
  "components": [
    "components/navigation-class.psm1",
    "components/advanced-data-components.psm1",
    "components/tui-components.psm1",
    "components/advanced-input-components.psm1",
    "modules/dialog-system-class.psm1"
  ],
  "screens": [
    "screens/dashboard-screen.psm1",
    "screens/tasks-screen.psm1",
    "screens/logs-screen.psm1"
  ]
}
```

## Execution Workflow

### For Each Phase:

1. **Pre-Phase Checkpoint**
   ```powershell
   New-RefactorCheckpoint -Name "phase-X-start" -Description "Before phase X"
   ```

2. **Execute Modifications**
   - I modify files according to the phase plan
   - Each modification is wrapped in error handling
   - Context is set for error tracking

3. **Validation**
   ```powershell
   Test-TuiComponent -ComponentFile "..." -TestScenario {...}
   ```

4. **Performance Check**
   ```powershell
   Measure-TuiPerformance -Scenario {...}
   ```

5. **Commit or Rollback**
   - If tests pass: Continue
   - If tests fail: `Restore-RefactorCheckpoint`

## Can I (LLM) Execute This?

**Yes, with the following setup:**

### Required from You:

1. **Run the Setup**
   ```powershell
   # Execute this first to initialize the infrastructure
   .\Start-TuiMigration.ps1
   ```

2. **Provide Clear Commands**
   ```powershell
   # Example: "Execute Phase 0"
   # I will then provide the complete modified files
   ```

3. **Run Validation After Each Phase**
   ```powershell
   # After I provide modifications, you run:
   Invoke-RefactorPhase -PhaseName "phase-0"
   ```

4. **Report Results**
   ```powershell
   # Share the output so I can adjust if needed
   Show-RefactorStatus
   Get-RefactorErrors -Unresolved
   ```

### My Capabilities:

- ✅ Generate complete file replacements (not patches)
- ✅ Track dependencies and update order
- ✅ Provide test scenarios for validation
- ✅ Debug based on error logs you share
- ✅ Suggest resolutions for common PowerShell issues

### My Limitations:

- ❌ Cannot directly execute PowerShell code
- ❌ Cannot see real-time console output
- ❌ Cannot access your file system directly
- ❌ Need you to run tests and report results

## Additional Tools That Would Help

### 1. **Visual Diff Tool**
```powershell
# A function to show before/after comparison
function Show-RefactorDiff {
    param([string]$File)
    # Compare checkpoint version with current
}
```

### 2. **Dependency Analyzer**
```powershell
# Analyze which components depend on which
function Get-ComponentDependencies {
    param([string]$ComponentFile)
    # Parse 'using module' statements and class inheritance
}
```

### 3. **Migration Simulator**
```powershell
# Dry-run the migration without actual changes
function Test-MigrationPlan {
    # Simulate each phase and predict issues
}
```

## Error Prevention Patterns

### Common PowerShell 7 Issues to Avoid:

1. **Module Load Order**
   ```powershell
   # Always load in dependency order
   using module .\base.psm1
   using module .\derived.psm1  # Must come after base
   ```

2. **Class Method Scoping**
   ```powershell
   # Use module-qualified calls in classes
   [void] Render() {
       & (Get-Module TuiEngine) { Write-BufferString -X 0 -Y 0 -Text "Hello" }
   }
   ```

3. **Null Reference Prevention**
   ```powershell
   # Always check before use
   if ($null -ne $this.Parent -and $this.Parent._private_buffer) {
       # Safe to use
   }
   ```

## Success Criteria

Each phase is considered successful when:

1. **No Unresolved Errors**: `Get-RefactorErrors -Unresolved` returns empty
2. **All Tests Pass**: Component tests show "Passed = $true"
3. **Performance Maintained**: No regression in render times
4. **Visual Integrity**: Snapshots match expected output

## Project Personality for LLM

When executing this migration, I will adopt the following traits:

- **Methodical**: Never skip steps or make assumptions
- **Defensive**: Always add null checks and error handling
- **Verbose**: Provide detailed comments explaining changes
- **Conservative**: Prefer safety over cleverness
- **Transparent**: Clearly state any uncertainties or risks

## Start Command

To begin the migration:

```powershell
# 1. Initialize the migration system
.\Start-TuiMigration.ps1

# 2. Tell me: "Execute Pre-Phase A"
# 3. I will provide the complete modifications
# 4. You run the validation
# 5. We iterate until successful
```

This enhanced plan provides a professional-grade migration framework with safety, validation, and optimal human-LLM collaboration.
