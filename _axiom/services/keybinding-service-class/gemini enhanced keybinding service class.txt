You've correctly identified that these two files work together to define the `KeybindingService`. This is a crucial service, as it forms the bridge between user input and the `ActionService`.

The provided implementation is very capable. It supports different key types, modifiers, context-based bindings, and even import/export functionality. My enhancements will focus on integrating it more deeply with the `ActionService`, improving performance, and hardening its API.

## Enhanced Keybinding Service Module

This refined version transforms the `KeybindingService` from a simple key-to-action-name mapper into a more intelligent service that is deeply integrated with the `ActionService`. This creates a more cohesive and powerful command system.

### Summary of Enhancements & Rationale:

1.  **Direct Integration with `ActionService`**:
    *   **Issue:** The original service was completely decoupled. It knew about action *names* (strings) but had no connection to the `ActionService` itself. This meant it couldn't provide richer information, like an action's description or category. The `HandleKey` method was also overly complex, having to check for global handlers separately.
    *   **Enhancement:**
        *   The `KeybindingService` constructor now requires an `[ActionService]` instance as a mandatory parameter, establishing a formal dependency.
        *   The `HandleKey` method is dramatically simplified. Instead of returning an action name or calling a handler, it now finds the matching action name and **immediately calls `$this.{_actionService}.ExecuteAction($actionName)`**.
        *   The concept of "global handlers" is removed from this service, as that logic is now entirely encapsulated within the `ActionService` itself.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the most significant architectural improvement. The `KeybindingService` now has a single, clear responsibility: **translate a `[ConsoleKeyInfo]` into an `ActionService.ExecuteAction()` call.** This greatly simplifies the input processing pipeline in the TUI Engine and makes the entire command flow more linear and easier to trace.

2.  **Performance-Optimized Key Lookup**:
    *   **Issue:** The `GetAction` method performed a linear search through *all* registered keybindings for every single key press. This is highly inefficient.
    *   **Enhancement:**
        *   The internal `$KeyMap` is restructured. Instead of mapping `actionName -> binding`, it now maps a **unique key signature string -> actionName**.
        *   A new private helper, `_GetKeySignature()`, is created. It deterministically converts a `[ConsoleKeyInfo]` object into a predictable string (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+A`, `F5`, `DownArrow`).
        *   The `IsAction` and `GetAction` methods are now replaced by a single, high-performance dictionary lookup: `$actionName = $this.{_keyMap}[$keySignature]`.
    *   **Rationale:** This provides a massive performance boost. Key press handling is now an O(1) dictionary lookup instead of an O(n) linear scan, ensuring the application remains responsive even with hundreds of keybindings.

3.  **Context-Aware Bindings (Scoping)**:
    *   **Issue:** The original context stack was a good idea but wasn't fully utilized in the key lookup logic.
    *   **Enhancement:** The new key signature format can incorporate a context prefix (e.g., `editor.Ctrl+S`, `global.Ctrl+Q`). The `HandleKey` method now intelligently searches for a context-specific binding first (`<current_context>.<key_signature>`) before falling back to a global binding (`global.<key_signature>`).
    *   **Rationale:** This makes the context system truly functional, allowing different screens or components (e.g., "editor", "list-view") to have their own specific keybindings that override global ones without conflict.

4.  **Automatic Binding from `ActionService`**:
    *   **Issue:** A developer had to register an action with the `ActionService` and *then* separately register a key for it with the `KeybindingService`. This is a two-step process prone to error.
    *   **Enhancement:**
        *   A new `[Action]` class is introduced (which would be shared with the `ActionService`) that includes a `[string]$DefaultHotkey` property.
        *   The `KeybindingService` can now have a method like `RegisterBindingsFromActions()`, which iterates through all actions from the `ActionService` and automatically creates a keybinding if a `DefaultHotkey` is defined.
    *   **Rationale:** This streamlines development significantly. A developer can now define an action and its default keybinding in one place. The services handle wiring them up automatically, reducing boilerplate and potential for error.

### Conclusion

This enhanced `KeybindingService` represents a significant architectural improvement.
*   **Decoupled & Focused:** It now has one job: translate key presses into `ActionService` calls. All other responsibilities (like invoking scriptblocks) have been correctly moved to the `ActionService`.
*   **High Performance:** Key lookups are now instantaneous, ensuring the UI remains snappy.
*   **Simplified Workflow:** By automatically registering bindings from the `ActionService`, it removes a manual step for developers and reduces the chance of error.
*   **Truly Contextual:** The context stack is now a core part of the lookup logic, making it a powerful feature for creating sophisticated, mode-based UIs.

This completes the enhancement of the core service layer. All services (`ActionService`, `ThemeManager`, `KeybindingService`, `DataManager`, etc.) are now modern, robust, and deeply integrated with each other, providing a solid foundation for the entire application.
