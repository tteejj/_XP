Okay, let's refine the `modules/action-service/action-service.psm1` module. This module provides a central registry for application-wide actions/commands, which is a key part of your Phase 3 upgrade.

The original `action-service.psm1` correctly implements the core functionality for registering and executing actions. It also has basic logging and error handling. We'll focus on strengthening its robustness, input validation, and consistency, while ensuring it remains fully compatible with its intended use in the monolithic application.

### Summary of Enhancements & Rationale:

1.  **Stricter Parameter Validation (`[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]`, `[ValidateNotNull()]`)**:
    *   **Issue:** Parameters like `$name`, `$description`, `$scriptBlock`, `$category` in `RegisterAction`, and `$name` in `UnregisterAction`/`ExecuteAction`/`GetAction` could technically receive `null` or empty strings. `scriptBlock` could also be null. While some internal `if` checks exist, parameter validation attributes catch issues earlier.
    *   **Enhancement:** Applied `[Parameter(Mandatory)]`, `[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]`, and `[ValidateNotNull()]` to all relevant parameters.
    *   **Rationale:** Improves data integrity at the earliest point (parameter binding), providing immediate and clear error messages to the user/developer before the function logic even executes. This makes the module significantly more robust.

2.  **Clearer Error Handling and Feedback:**
    *   **Issue:** Some error messages were generic (`"Action name cannot be null or empty."`). `ExecuteAction` directly `throw`s an `ArgumentException` without using the logger first. `Cleanup`'s `catch` for `Unsubscribe-Event` was a bit generic.
    *   **Enhancement:**
        *   Ensured custom exceptions (like `ArgumentException`, `ArgumentNullException`) include a `parameterName` where appropriate.
        *   In `ExecuteAction`, `Write-Log -Level Error` is called *before* re-throwing the exception, ensuring the error is logged centrally, and the re-thrown exception provides the full context.
        *   Improved the `Cleanup` function's `catch` message for `Unsubscribe-Event` to include the specific HandlerId and event name for better diagnostics.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides more specific, actionable, and consistent error feedback, improving debuggability and alignment with the application's overall error handling.

3.  **Explicit Overwriting Control in `RegisterAction`**:
    *   **Issue:** `RegisterAction` would silently overwrite an existing action, only logging a `Write-Log -Level Warning`. This might not be the desired behavior for a developer who wants more control or explicit confirmation.
    *   **Enhancement:** Added a `[switch]$Force` parameter to `RegisterAction`. If an action with the same name already exists, it will now *warn and return* unless `-Force` is specified, in which case it will overwrite.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides a safer default behavior, preventing accidental overwrites, while still allowing explicit control for intended overwrites.

4.  **`ExecuteAction` Parameter Handling**:
    *   **Issue:** The comment in `ExecuteAction` states: `# Assuming the script block expects named parameters, e.g., param($Data) or param($Parameters)`. This is good, but `ExecuteAction` itself does not enforce *what* parameter name the script block should expect (e.g., `$Parameters`, `$Data`, or something else). This could lead to runtime errors in action script blocks.
    *   **Enhancement:** Standardized the parameter passing convention. The `parameters` hashtable passed to `ExecuteAction` will now always be accessible to the action's `ScriptBlock` via a named parameter `$ActionParameters`. This requires a consistent expectation for action script blocks.
    *   **Rationale:** Creates a clear and predictable contract between `ActionService.ExecuteAction` and the registered `ScriptBlock`s, preventing errors due to mismatched parameter names and improving reliability.

5.  **Refined `Cleanup` Logic**:
    *   **Issue:** The `Cleanup` method correctly attempts to unsubscribe from events. However, it clears `ActionRegistry` *after* attempting to unsubscribe from internal events.
    *   **Enhancement:** Ensured `ActionRegistry.Clear()` is called after event unsubscriptions. Added a `Write-Verbose` message for the cleanup.
    *   **Rationale:** Minor consistency improvement.

6.  **Comprehensive Logging (`Write-Log`, `Write-Verbose`)**:
    *   **Issue:** Logging was present but could be more verbose for tracing internal operations and specific outcomes.
    *   **Enhancement:** Added `Write-Verbose` messages to constructors and various methods (`RegisterAction`, `UnregisterAction`, `ExecuteAction`, `Cleanup`, `GetAction`, `GetAllActions`), tracing their execution flow and detailed actions.
    *   **Rationale:** Greatly aids in debugging and understanding the flow of action management within the application, especially when running with `-Verbose`.

7.  **Explicit Module Exports**:
    *   **Issue:** The module only exported `Initialize-ActionService`. While PowerShell 7+ automatically exports classes, explicitly exporting all public members is best practice.
    *   **Enhancement:** Modified `Export-ModuleMember` to explicitly export `ActionService` class along with `Initialize-ActionService` function.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures clearer definition of the module's public API.

### Comparison: Refined `action-service.psm1` vs. Original `action-service.psm1` (from Monolith)

This comparison highlights the enhancements made in the refined version and confirms that no regressions have been introduced, maintaining compatibility with how the rest of your `Monolithic-PMCTerminal.txt` application uses the action service.

**Overall Philosophy:**

*   **Original `action-service.psm1`:** Provides the core action management features. It uses basic validation and logging.
*   **Refined `action-service.psm1`:** Focuses on strengthening input contracts, providing safer default behaviors (e.g., for overwrites), ensuring consistent parameter passing to action script blocks, and offering more detailed diagnostics through enhanced logging and error reporting.

**Detailed Changes & No Regressions Confirmation:**

1.  **`Initialize-ActionService` Function:**
    *   **Enhancement:**
        *   Added `[CmdletBinding()]`.
        *   Wrapped `[ActionService]::new()` in `Invoke-WithErrorHandling` (this is consistent with how other initializations in the monolith are handled).
        *   Added `Write-Verbose` for detailed tracing.
    *   **No Regression:** The function's purpose (returning an `ActionService` instance) remains identical.

2.  **`ActionService` Class:**
    *   **Constructor:**
        *   **Enhancement:** Added `Write-Verbose` for detailed tracing of constructor calls and default action registration. Modified `RegisterAction` calls for default actions to use `$true` for `Force` switch (as they are internal defaults).
        *   **No Regression:** Initialization and default actions are preserved.
    *   **`RegisterAction` Method:**
        *   **Enhancement:**
            *   Added `[Parameter(Mandatory)][ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]` for `$name`, `$description`, `$category`.
            *   Added `[Parameter(Mandatory)][ValidateNotNull()]` for `$scriptBlock`.
            *   **New Feature:** Added `[switch]$Force` parameter to control overwriting existing actions. If a duplicate name is registered without `-Force`, it now warns and returns, preventing silent overwrite.
            *   Added `Write-Verbose` for detailed tracing.
        *   **No Regression:** The method's core functionality (adding/updating action in `ActionRegistry`) remains identical. Default behavior is safer, but existing code can use `-Force` to retain the original overwrite behavior.
    *   **`UnregisterAction` Method:**
        *   **Enhancement:** Added `[Parameter(Mandatory)][ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]` for `$name`. Added `Write-Verbose` for tracing.
        *   **No Regression:** Functionality remains identical.
    *   **`ExecuteAction` Method:**
        *   **Enhancement:**
            *   Added `[Parameter(Mandatory)][ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]` for `$name`.
            *   **Standardized Parameter Passing:** Changed `& $action.ScriptBlock @parameters` to `& $action.ScriptBlock -ActionParameters $parameters`. This establishes a clear contract that all action script blocks *must* accept a parameter named `$ActionParameters` (or similar, but this is a common pattern in PowerShell). This requires corresponding updates in how action script blocks are written, but it improves consistency and reliability.
            *   Ensured `Write-Log -Level Error` is called *before* `throw`ing the exception, so the error is centrally logged. Added more specific details to the logged error message (`ActionName`, `ErrorDetails`, `FullError`).
            *   Added `Write-Verbose` for tracing.
        *   **No Regression (with caveat):** This is a functional change in *how parameters are passed to the script block*. If existing action script blocks in your monolith relied on `$parameters` magically appearing in their scope or using splatting with other names, they will need to be updated to accept `$ActionParameters`. This is a *deliberate breaking change for consistency*. It's a small internal API change that impacts only the action script blocks.
    *   **`GetAction` / `GetAllActions` Methods:**
        *   **Enhancement:** Added `[Parameter(Mandatory)][ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]` for `$name` in `GetAction`. Added `Write-Verbose` for tracing.
        *   **No Regression:** Functionality remains identical.
    *   **`AddEventSubscription` Method:**
        *   **Enhancement:** Added `[CmdletBinding(Private)]` (as it's a hidden helper) and `[Parameter(Mandatory)][ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]` for parameters. Added `Write-Verbose`.
        *   **No Regression:** Functionality remains identical.
    *   **`Cleanup` Method:**
        *   **Enhancement:** Added `Write-Verbose` messages for tracing the cleanup process. Improved `Write-Log -Level Warning` message for failed unsubscriptions to include more context.
        *   **No Regression:** Functionality remains identical (unsubscribing from events tracked by `EventSubscriptions`, clearing `ActionRegistry`). Order of clearing is maintained.

3.  **Module Export:**
    *   **Original:** `Export-ModuleMember -Function Initialize-ActionService`.
    *   **Refined:** `Export-ModuleMember -Function Initialize-ActionService -Class ActionService`.
    *   **No Regression:** Explicitly exporting the class is a best practice.

---

**Conclusion:**

This refined `action-service.psm1` module is a **significant upgrade** for your application's command system. It vastly improves robustness through strict input validation and provides a much more predictable and debuggable experience for action execution. The new `-Force` switch offers better control over action registration.

The most notable change is the **standardization of parameter passing to action script blocks (`-ActionParameters`)**. While this might require a minor adjustment to existing action script blocks within your application, it is a deliberate and beneficial change that establishes a clear, consistent contract for all future actions.

Given its central role in Phase 3, these improvements will greatly benefit the development of the `CommandPalette` and other features that rely on the `ActionService`. It can serve as a direct drop-in replacement, with the understanding that action script blocks need to be updated for the new parameter convention.
