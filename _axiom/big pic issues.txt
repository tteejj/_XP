The provided PowerShell modules represent a sophisticated Terminal User Interface (TUI) framework built with a strong emphasis on modularity, modern design patterns, and robustness. The overall integration is generally well-executed, leveraging several key architectural patterns to promote decoupling and maintainability.

### Overall Architecture & Strengths:

1.  **Dependency Injection (DI) through Service Container**:
    *   **Strength**: The `ServiceContainer` is a central and well-implemented DI mechanism. It supports eager vs. lazy loading, singleton vs. transient lifestyles, and most importantly, provides a `Cleanup()` method for managing `IDisposable` services. This is a critical pattern for managing application state and resources in a long-running PowerShell application.
    *   **Integration**: `run.ps1` correctly initializes the `ServiceContainer` and registers all core services (`DataManager`, `ActionService`, `KeybindingService`, `NavigationService`, `TuiFrameworkService`) using factories. Screens (`DashboardScreen`, `TaskListScreen`) receive the `ServiceContainer` in their constructors and pull necessary services from it (`$this.ServiceContainer.GetService(...)`). This promotes loose coupling.

2.  **Event System (Pub/Sub)**:
    *   **Strength**: The `EventSystem` module (`Publish-Event`, `Subscribe-Event`, `Unsubscribe-Event`) is a robust and essential component for decoupled communication between services and UI components. It explicitly supports `HandlerId` and `Source` for targeted cleanup.
    *   **Integration**: Used effectively for:
        *   Notifying UI components of data changes (`Tasks.Changed` event from `DataManager` to `TaskListScreen` and `DashboardScreen`).
        *   Application-level events (`Application.Exit`, `Screen.Pushed`, `TUI.Resized`).
        *   `Screen` base class provides `SubscribeToEvent` helper which tracks subscriptions for automatic cleanup in `Screen.Cleanup()`. This is excellent for preventing memory leaks.

3.  **Centralized Error Handling & Logging**:
    *   **Strength**: The `exceptions.psm1` module (`Invoke-WithErrorHandling`) provides a consistent, centralized mechanism for catching, logging, and re-throwing errors. It integrates with `logger.psm1` for detailed diagnostics and `panic-handler.psm1` for unhandled fatal errors. Custom `HeliosException` types offer structured error data.
    *   **Integration**: `Invoke-WithErrorHandling` is extensively used across most service and component methods, ensuring that operations are wrapped for resilience and diagnostic clarity. This is a significant strength for debugging and production stability.

4.  **UI Component Lifecycle Management**:
    *   **Strength**: The `UIElement` base class and its subclasses (`Screen`, `Panel`, `Table`, `TextBox`, `Dialog`) define a clear lifecycle (`OnInitialize`, `OnEnter`, `OnExit`, `OnResume`, `OnRender`, `HandleInput`, `OnFocus`, `OnBlur`). The `TUI Engine` orchestrates these calls effectively.
    *   **Integration**:
        *   `OnInitialize` is used for one-time setup (e.g., creating child components, registering actions).
        *   `OnEnter`/`OnExit`/`OnResume` manage screen transitions and associated resources (like keybinding contexts).
        *   `Cleanup` methods are implemented in `Screen` to release resources and unsubscribe from events.

5.  **Theme Integration**:
    *   **Strength**: `ThemeManager` supports both simple `ConsoleColor` themes and advanced `palette`/`styles` with hex colors. Components retrieve colors via `Get-ThemeColor`, ensuring consistency.
    *   **Integration**: Components like `Table`, `TextBoxComponent`, `ButtonComponent`, `Dialog` directly call `Get-ThemeColor`, making them theme-aware. The `Theme.Changed` event allows components to react to theme switches (though explicit redraw requests might be needed on individual components, this is generally handled by `Request-TuiRefresh` from the `Theme.Changed` event or `Set-TuiTheme` itself).

6.  **Keybinding & Command Palette**:
    *   **Strength**: `KeybindingService` allows flexible definition of key-to-action mappings, supporting modifiers and context stacks. The `CommandPalette` provides a discoverable interface for all registered actions.
    *   **Integration**: `TaskListScreen` demonstrates good contextual keybinding management (`PushContext`/`PopContext`). `CommandPalette` pulls all actions from `ActionService` and uses `KeybindingService` for its activation shortcut, showcasing excellent cross-service cooperation.

7.  **Rendering Optimization**:
    *   **Strength**: `TuiBuffer` provides efficient cell-based rendering. `Render-CompositorToConsole` uses differential rendering (only updating changed cells) to minimize console writes, which is crucial for TUI performance. `RequestRedraw` correctly propagates dirty flags up the component tree.

### Systemic Issues & Areas for Improvement:

1.  **Inconsistent `Initialize-DialogSystem` Call**:
    *   **Issue**: `run.ps1` calls `Initialize-DialogSystem`, but no such function is exported or defined in `dialog-system-class.psm1`. The `Dialog` and its child classes (`AlertDialog`, `ConfirmDialog`, `InputDialog`) are directly `new()`d and used via `Show-*Dialog` functions.
    *   **Impact**: This is a minor naming inconsistency or a remnant of an older design. The dialog system still functions, but the call is a no-op and misleading.
    *   **Recommendation**: Remove `Initialize-DialogSystem` from `run.ps1` or create a dummy function if it's meant to be a placeholder for future dialog-system-wide initialization. Given the current design, it's not needed.

2.  **`Initialize-NavigationService` Parameter**:
    *   **Issue**: `navigation-service-functions.psm1` defines `Initialize-NavigationService` to accept a `[hashtable]$Services`. However, `run.ps1` calls it with `Initialize-NavigationService -ServiceContainer $c`. The `navigation-service-class.psm1` `NavigationService` constructor expects a `[hashtable]$services` but the screen factory within it also expects `[hashtable]$services`. This is a mismatch in parameter names and types for the DI approach.
    *   **Impact**: This indicates a slight confusion in the DI pattern. If `Initialize-NavigationService` is meant to be a factory that receives the `ServiceContainer` and then populates its internal `Services` hashtable (for backward compatibility, as noted), it should explicitly take `[object]$serviceContainer` and not `[hashtable]$Services`. The `NavigationService` class constructor itself *should* take the `ServiceContainer` if it's truly consuming services from it.
    *   **Recommendation**:
        *   In `navigation-service-functions.psm1`, change `param([hashtable]$Services)` to `param([Parameter(Mandatory)][object]$ServiceContainer)`.
        *   In `navigation-service-class.psm1`, `NavigationService` constructor should be `NavigationService([object]$serviceContainer)`.
        *   Then, within the `NavigationService` constructor, properly extract services from `$serviceContainer` if needed for `this.Services` hashtable, or preferably, directly use `$this.ServiceContainer.GetService()`. The existing `Screen` constructors already do this properly.
        *   The current `ScreenFactory` implementation directly uses `[hashtable]$Services` in its constructor. It should also be updated to consistently take `[object]$serviceContainer`.

3.  **Global `Write-Log`, `Publish-Event`, etc. dependency**:
    *   **Issue**: Many classes directly call global functions like `Write-Log`, `Publish-Event`, `Get-ThemeColor`, `Show-AlertDialog`, etc., without them being explicitly injected or available via `$this.Services`.
    *   **Impact**: While PowerShell makes globally sourced functions available, relying on implicit global availability makes unit testing harder and masks dependencies. For example, `PmcTask` and `PmcProject` models call `Write-Warning` directly instead of using the injected `Logger` service.
    *   **Recommendation**: For core services that are critical and meant to be globally available (Logger, EventSystem, ThemeManager, Dialogs, PanicHandler), this pattern is somewhat acceptable in a PowerShell framework (similar to static facades in other languages). However, for classes like `PmcTask` or `PmcProject`, it would be cleaner if they took a `Logger` or `EventSystem` instance (or a helper object that wraps logging/events) in their constructor if they need to log/publish events. For TUI components, `Get-ThemeColor` is acceptable due to its nature. `Show-AlertDialog` is effectively a global helper, which is fine for UI calls.

4.  **Redundant `PSObject.Properties.Match` in Factories**:
    *   **Issue**: Factory functions like `New-TuiTable`, `New-TuiMultilineTextBox`, etc., use `$component.PSObject.Properties.Match($_.Name)` to check if a property exists before assigning.
    *   **Impact**: While harmless, this is generally unnecessary if `Props` are expected to match defined properties. Direct assignment `$component.($propertyName) = $propertyValue` will simply fail (and be caught by `Invoke-WithErrorHandling`) if the property doesn't exist, which is often preferable to silently skipping.
    *   **Recommendation**: Consider simplifying these loops to directly assign properties, relying on `Invoke-WithErrorHandling` for error capture. This is a minor point, but it clutters the factories.

5.  **`Panel` `HandleInput` Delegation Logic**:
    *   **Issue**: `Panel.HandleInput` first calls `([Panel]$this).HandleInput($keyInfo)` (which recursively calls itself unless `CanFocus` is true and a Tab/Enter is hit) and then iterates children. For `GroupPanel`, it re-calls `([Panel]$this).HandleInput($keyInfo)` after its own logic. This looks like it could lead to infinite recursion or unclear delegation if not carefully managed.
    *   **Impact**: The `[UIElement]$this).HandleInput($keyInfo)` call in `Panel` and `GroupPanel` does *not* recursively call `HandleInput` but rather the `UIElement` base's `HandleInput` (which returns `$false`). This is okay. The deeper issue is in `GroupPanel`'s re-calling `([Panel]$this).HandleInput($keyInfo)` *after* it has already handled its own focus/toggle logic. It means the base `Panel`'s child delegation logic might be run *twice* for a given key, or the key might be handled by the parent Panel, then by the GroupPanel, then by the parent Panel again trying to delegate to children.
    *   **Recommendation**: The base `UIElement.HandleInput` should return `$false` and its role is just to log. The chain of command for input should be: `TUIEngine` -> `OverlayStack` (top-down) -> `CurrentScreen` -> `FocusedComponent`. `Panel` (if `CanFocus`) or `GroupPanel` would be a `FocusedComponent`. If a `Panel` itself is focused, it *then* tries to delegate to its children. If a `Panel` is NOT focused, its `HandleInput` should probably not be called directly by the engine, but rather the focused child's `HandleInput` inside the panel would be called.
        *   Clarify `Panel.HandleInput`'s role: should it delegate only if *it* is focused, or should it always be part of the delegation chain? The current `TUI Engine` design (routing to `FocusedComponent`) implies only the focused component gets input. If a panel is focused, it then handles the input and *itself* decides if it wants to pass it to *its* children. The `HandleInput` in `Panel` and `GroupPanel` seems to correctly follow this. The specific line `return ([Panel]$this).HandleInput($keyInfo)` in `GroupPanel` is the main concern as it implies re-calling the `Panel`'s input logic again, which is redundant and potentially problematic. It should instead explicitly iterate and delegate to its children if needed after the GroupPanel-specific logic.

6.  **Direct `Get-Command` Checks for Global Functions**:
    *   **Issue**: Many modules use `if (Get-Command 'FunctionName' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)` before calling global functions (`Write-Log`, `Publish-Event`, `Show-AlertDialog`, etc.).
    *   **Impact**: This adds overhead and verbose logging. While robust for isolated module testing or partial loading, in a monolithic application with a defined load order, these functions *will* exist after initialization.
    *   **Recommendation**: Given `run.ps1` explicitly sources these modules early, these `Get-Command` checks are mostly unnecessary and can be removed for cleaner, slightly more performant code in a production build, relying on the `ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` and `Invoke-WithErrorHandling` for error propagation.

7.  **Overuse of `Write-Verbose`**:
    *   **Issue**: `Write-Verbose` is used very heavily, often for simple state changes or method calls.
    *   **Impact**: This generates an extremely high volume of verbose output, making it difficult to read and potentially impacting performance in debug mode.
    *   **Recommendation**: Re-evaluate the verbosity level. Reserve `Write-Verbose` for significant state transitions or complex logic entry/exit. For routine operations, `Write-Log -Level Debug` (which is configurable) is generally preferred as it's part of the application's structured logging system.

8.  **`$global:TuiState` and DI**:
    *   **Issue**: `TuiEngine` relies heavily on `$global:TuiState`. While `TuiEngine` itself isn't *directly* registered as a service and injected, its state (`$global:TuiState`) is implicitly used by many components (e.g., `Dialog` centering, `Check-ForResize`).
    *   **Impact**: This is a direct global dependency, making `TuiEngine` less of a "service" and more of a global manager. It makes `TuiEngine` difficult to swap out or test in isolation.
    *   **Recommendation**: For a true DI approach, the `TuiEngine` instance itself (or a facade that holds `$global:TuiState`) could be registered as a singleton service. Components requiring TUI dimensions or overlay management would `GetService("TuiEngine")` and interact with its methods (`$tuiEngine.GetBufferWidth()`, `$tuiEngine.ShowOverlay()`). However, this would be a significant refactor and might add complexity for little gain given the nature of a TUI framework where a central engine is almost inherently a singleton. The current approach is pragmatic for PowerShell.

### Integration Summary:

The modules are **very well integrated** and follow a coherent architectural vision. The core is built around a robust **Dependency Injection** pattern using the `ServiceContainer`, a flexible **Event System** for decoupling, and a strong **Error Handling** strategy. The **UI component lifecycle** is clear and consistently managed by the `TUI Engine`. **Theme management** and **keybinding/command palette** are effectively integrated as cross-cutting concerns that all components can leverage.

The few identified "issues" are minor inconsistencies or areas for minor refinement rather than fundamental flaws in the integration strategy. The primary areas for attention are the parameter type mismatch in `Initialize-NavigationService` and the `Initialize-DialogSystem` call, which are easily fixed. The reliance on `Get-Command` checks for globally sourced functions is also an area that can be cleaned up in a final build.

Overall, this is a remarkably well-structured and integrated PowerShell application. The use of classes, lifecycle hooks, and service-oriented architecture demonstrates a mature approach to building complex PowerShell applications.
