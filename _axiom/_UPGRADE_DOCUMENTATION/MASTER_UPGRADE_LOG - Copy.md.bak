# PMC Terminal Axiom-Phoenix v4.0 Upgrade Master Log

## Overview
This document tracks the complete upgrade process from PMC Terminal v5 to Axiom-Phoenix v4.0. It serves as the primary reference for understanding all changes made, decisions taken, and the current state of the upgrade.

## Current Status
- **Start Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Phase:** Phase 1 Complete - Panic Handler Implemented
- **Last Updated:** 2025-01-03 - Panic handler fully integrated

### 4. Encapsulated Services & Dependency Injection
- **Status:** Not Started
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Components Affected:** All services, Screen constructors
- **Key Features:**
  - Formal service layer
  - $services container
  - Constructor-based DI
  - Resilient data loading

### 5. Fail-Fast Resilient Main Loop & Panic Handler
- **Status:** âœ… COMPLETE
- **Priority:** CRITICAL
- **Components Affected:** TUI Engine, New PanicHandler module
- **Key Features:**
  - Try/catch wrapped main loop
  - Crash dumping with diagnostics
  - Terminal restoration on panic
  - Screenshot of last good frame

## Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1:** Panic Handler (Foundation for safe development)
2. **Phase 2:** Dependency Injection & Service Container
3. **Phase 3:** Lifecycle-Aware Component Model
4. **Phase 4:** Truecolor Theming System
5. **Phase 5:** Command Palette & Action Service

## Decision Log

### Decision #1: Start with Panic Handler
**Date:** [Current]
**Rationale:** Before making any other changes, we need a safety net. The panic handler will ensure that any errors during development don't leave the terminal in an unusable state. This makes the entire upgrade process safer.

### Decision #2: Module Structure
**Date:** [Current]
**Rationale:** Following the Axiom principles, each new feature will be its own module with a proper manifest. This ensures clean dependencies and testability.

## File Changes Tracking

### New Files Created
1. `_UPGRADE_DOCUMENTATION/MASTER_UPGRADE_LOG.md` - This file
2. `modules/panic-handler/panic-handler.psm1` - Complete panic handler module

### Modified Files
1. `modules/tui-engine/tui-engine.psm1` - Added panic handler initialization and integration
2. `run.ps1` - Added panic-handler module to load order

## Testing Log
[Will document all tests performed]

## Known Issues
[Will track any issues discovered during upgrade]

## Recovery Points
[Will note safe states where the application is fully functional]

## Phase 1 Completion Summary

### What Was Implemented
1. **PanicHandler Class** - A robust error recovery system that:
   - Captures unhandled exceptions anywhere in the application
   - Immediately restores terminal to usable state (cursor visible, colors reset)
   - Creates detailed crash reports with full diagnostics
   - Saves crash logs to LocalAppData with automatic cleanup of old logs
   - Captures last rendered frame for debugging
   - Displays user-friendly error messages

2. **TUI Engine Integration**:
   - Panic handler initialized at engine startup
   - Main loop catch block now invokes panic handler
   - Last good frame stored after each successful render
   - Graceful fallback if panic handler unavailable

### Key Features Added
- **Terminal Safety**: No more broken terminals on crash
- **Diagnostic Reports**: Full crash dumps with stack traces, system info, and screen captures
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal of threads and resources on panic
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages with crash log locations

### Technical Details
- Uses static methods to ensure availability even in corrupted states
- Stores up to 10 crash logs with automatic rotation
- Captures buffer state as ASCII art in crash reports
- Handles recursive panics gracefully

### Next Phase
Phase 2 will implement the Dependency Injection and Service Container system to provide clean service management throughout the application.
