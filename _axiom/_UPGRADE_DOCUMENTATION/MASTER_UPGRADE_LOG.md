  - Searchable command palette (Ctrl+P)
  - Removal of rigid NavigationMenu
  - Extensible action system

### 4. Encapsulated Services & Dependency Injection

- **Key Features:**
  - Formal service layer
  - $services container
  - Constructor-based DI
  - Resilient data loading

### 5. Fail-Fast Resilient Main Loop & Panic Handler
- **Status:** âœ… COMPLETE
- **Priority:** CRITICAL
- **Components Affected:** TUI Engine, New PanicHandler module
- **Key Features:**
  - Try/catch wrapped main loop
  - Crash dumping with diagnostics
  - Terminal restoration on panic
  - Screenshot of last good frame

## Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1:** Panic Handler (Foundation for safe development) - **COMPLETE**
2. **Phase 2:** Dependency Injection & Service Container - **COMPLETE**
3. **Phase 3:** Command Palette & Action Service (High-impact user feature and service architecture pilot) - **IN PROGRESS**
4. **Phase 4:** Lifecycle-Aware Component Model
5. **Phase 5:** Truecolor Theming System

## Decision Log

### Decision #1: Start with Panic Handler
**Date:** 2025-01-03
**Rationale:** Before making any other changes, we need a safety net. The panic handler ensures that any errors during development don't leave the terminal in an unusable state. This makes the entire upgrade process safer.

### Decision #2: Module Structure
**Date:** 2025-01-03
**Rationale:** Following the Axiom principles, each new feature will be its own module with a proper manifest. This ensures clean dependencies, testability, and adherence to the project's architectural standards.

### Decision #3: Implement DI/Services Immediately After Panic Handler
**Date:** 2025-01-04
**Rationale:** The Service Container and Dependency Injection pattern are foundational to the new architecture. Implementing this early allows all subsequent features to be built cleanly, without tight coupling, making them more testable and maintainable from the start.

### Decision #4: Prioritize Action Service & Command Palette (Deviating from original plan)
**Date:** 2025-01-04
**Rationale:** While the original plan placed this later, building the `ActionService` immediately after the service container was a natural fit. This provides a high-impact user feature early in the upgrade cycle. Furthermore, building the `CommandPalette` component now serves as a perfect, real-world pilot case that will inform the final design of the more generic "Lifecycle-Aware Component Model" (Phase 4). This iterative approach is more likely to succeed than designing the abstract component model in a vacuum.

## File Changes Tracking

### New Files Created
1. `_UPGRADE_DOCUMENTATION/MASTER_UPGRADE_LOG.md` - This file
2. `modules/panic-handler/panic-handler.psm1` - Complete panic handler module
3. `modules/service-container/service-container.psm1` - Service container and DI provider
4. `modules/action-service/action-service.psm1` - Central registry for application commands
5. `modules/components/command-palette.psm1` - UI component for the command palette (In Progress)

### Modified Files
1. `run.ps1` - Added `panic-handler`, `service-container`, and `action-service` to the module load order.
2. `modules/tui-engine/tui-engine.psm1` - Integrated panic handler initialization, main loop wrapping, and service container instantiation.
3. `core/Screen.ps1` - Base class constructor updated to accept the `$services` container, enabling dependency injection for all screen-level components.

## Testing Log
[Will document all tests performed]

## Known Issues
[Will track any issues discovered during upgrade]

## Recovery Points
- **RP1 (2025-01-03):** Application is stable with the Panic Handler integrated. The foundation for safe development is complete.
- **RP2 (2025-01-04):** Application is stable with the Service Container and DI system integrated. All services are now loaded and managed through the container.

## Phase 1 Completion Summary

### What Was Implemented
1. **PanicHandler Class** - A robust error recovery system that captures unhandled exceptions, restores the terminal, creates detailed crash reports with diagnostics, and saves the last rendered frame for debugging.
2. **TUI Engine Integration** - The main loop is now wrapped in a try/catch block that invokes the panic handler, ensuring application-wide safety.

### Key Features Added
- **Terminal Safety**: No more broken terminals on crash.
- **Diagnostic Reports**: Full crash dumps with stack traces, system info, and screen captures.
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages with crash log locations.

## Phase 2 Completion Summary

### What Was Implemented
1. **ServiceContainer Class** - A centralized container to register, manage, and retrieve application-wide services (e.g., logging, configuration, actions).
2. **Dependency Injection Pattern** - Implemented constructor-based DI. The main TUI Engine now creates the service container and passes it to the constructor of all `Screen` objects.
3. **Module Integration** - The `run.ps1` script now loads the service container module early in the startup sequence, making it available to all subsequent modules.

### Key Features Added
- **Decoupling**: Components and services are no longer tightly coupled. Screens request the services they need, rather than creating them.
- **Testability**: Services and components can be tested in isolation by injecting mock services.
- **Centralized Management**: Provides a single, predictable place to manage the lifecycle of shared resources.

### Next Phase
**Phase 3 (Current):** Complete the `CommandPalette` UI component. This involves creating a new lifecycle-aware component that can be rendered as an overlay, handle user input for searching/filtering actions from the `ActionService`, and execute the selected command.
