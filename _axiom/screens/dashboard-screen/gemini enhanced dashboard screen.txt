Excellent. Reviewing the `DashboardScreen` is the perfect way to see how all of our architectural upgrades come together in a real-world use case. This screen is the user's first impression, and modernizing it is a key goal.

The provided `DashboardScreen.psm1` code is a good representation of the old architecture. It manually builds a UI with a static `NavigationMenu` and uses hardcoded colors. My enhancement will refactor it to fully embrace the new Axiom-Phoenix patterns: the **Lifecycle Model**, the **ActionService**, and the **ThemeManager**.

## Enhanced Dashboard Screen

This refined version of the `DashboardScreen` is a complete rewrite that showcases the power and elegance of the new framework. It is simpler, more flexible, and more maintainable than the original.

### Summary of Enhancements & Rationale:

1.  **Full Adoption of the Component Lifecycle**:
    *   **Issue:** The original screen had a massive `Initialize()` method that acted like a constructor, building the entire UI tree. This is an anti-pattern in a lifecycle-aware framework.
    *   **Enhancement:**
        *   The constructor is now minimal, only calling its base constructor.
        *   All UI component creation and setup logic has been moved to the `OnInitialize()` override. This is the correct lifecycle hook for one-time setup.
        *   Event subscriptions (e.g., for `Tasks.Changed`) are now also made in `OnInitialize()`. The `Screen`'s base `Cleanup()` method will automatically handle their unsubscription.
    *   **Rationale:** This makes the screen's creation and destruction predictable and safe. Resources are allocated and released at the correct, designated times, preventing memory leaks and aligning with the framework's core design.

2.  **Removal of the Static `NavigationMenu`**:
    *   **Issue:** The main feature of the original dashboard was a large, static `NavigationMenu`. This is rigid and has been superseded by the `CommandPalette`.
    *   **Enhancement:**
        *   The `$MenuPanel` and `$MainMenu` have been **completely removed**.
        *   The actions previously in the menu (`GoTo /tasks`, `Quit Application`, etc.) are now expected to be registered with the `ActionService`. The user will access them via the `CommandPalette` (`Ctrl+P`).
        *   A new `HelpPanel` is added to guide the user, explicitly telling them to press `Ctrl+P`.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the most significant user-facing change. It modernizes the UI, declutters the screen, and fully commits to the new, more powerful action-based navigation model.

3.  **Complete Theme Integration**:
    *   **Issue:** The original screen used hardcoded `[ConsoleColor]` values for every panel border and all text elements.
    *   **Enhancement:** All `WriteTextToPanel` and `Panel` constructor calls have been refactored to use the `ThemeManager`. Panels now get their colors from semantic theme keys like `panel.border`, and text uses keys like `text.header`, `text.highlight`, and `text.normal`.
    *   **Rationale:** This makes the `DashboardScreen`'s appearance entirely data-driven. Its look and feel can be completely transformed by simply changing the active theme, with no code changes required.

4.  **Dynamic, Event-Driven Data Updates**:
    *   **Issue:** The original screen only loaded data once in `OnEnter`. If a task was changed elsewhere in the application, the dashboard summary would become stale until the user left and re-entered the screen.
    *   **Enhancement:** The screen now subscribes to the `Tasks.Changed` event from the `DataManager`. Whenever a task is created, updated, or deleted anywhere in the app, this event fires, and the dashboard's `RefreshData()` and `UpdateDisplay()` methods are called automatically.
    *   **Rationale:** This makes the UI feel alive and responsive. The data displayed is always guaranteed to be up-to-date, providing a much better user experience.

5.  **Simplified and Declarative Layout**:
    *   **Issue:** The original layout involved many manual calculations for panel positions (`$menuX = $summaryWidth + 4`, etc.).
    *   **Enhancement:** The layout is simplified. The main content is now in two columns. The new `HelpPanel` shows how simple text formatting can create a clean, modern look without excessive borders. The code is more readable and focused on *what* to display, not complex coordinate math.
    *   **Rationale:** Improves the maintainability of the UI code.

### Conclusion

The `DashboardScreen` is now a prime example of the Axiom-Phoenix architecture in action.
*   **Component-Based:** It composes its UI from reusable `Panel` children.
*   **Lifecycle-Aware:** It uses `OnInitialize` for setup and relies on the framework for cleanup.
*   **Service-Oriented:** It consumes the `DataManager`, `ThemeManager`, and `KeybindingService` via dependency injection.
*   **Event-Driven:** It automatically updates its display in response to global `Tasks.Changed` events.
*   **Modern UX:** It directs the user to the `CommandPalette`, embracing the new, flexible navigation model over the old, rigid menu.

This refactoring not only modernizes the code but also significantly improves the user experience and the maintainability of the application's main screen.
