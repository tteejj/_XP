# Key Handling Fixes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **Case-Sensitive Keys Now Work**
- Changed from `-eq` to `-ceq` operator for case-sensitive comparison
- 'E' (uppercase) now opens detail screen
- 'e' (lowercase) does inline edit

### 2. **'a' Key Now Opens Detail Screen**
- Previously: Created task with inline edit
- Now: Opens full detail screen for new task
- Can set all fields before saving
- Esc cancels and removes the task

### 3. **Delete Confirmation**
- 'd' key now properly shows red confirmation dialog
- Press 'y' to confirm delete
- Press 'n' to cancel

## How It Works Now

| Key | Action | Visual Feedback |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| a | Add new task (detail screen) | Opens separate edit screen |
| e | Quick edit title (inline) | Yellow background on task line |
| E | Edit all fields (detail screen) | Opens separate edit screen |
| d | Delete task | Red confirmation dialog |
| s | Add subtask (inline) | Yellow background, shows "EDITING SUBTASK" |

## Detail Screen Controls
- Arrow keys: Navigate between fields
- Enter: Edit selected field
- Left/Right: Change choice fields (Status/Priority)
- F2: Save all changes
- Esc: Cancel (removes new tasks)

## Important Notes
- Make sure you're in the TASKS pane (use Tab to switch)
- Case matters: 'e' vs 'E' do different things
- The detail screen is modal - you must save or cancel to return
