# FIXES APPLIED TO AXIOM-PHOENIX v4.0

## 1. NEW TASK SCREEN - PROPER SPACING
**File:** `Screens\ASC.004_NewTaskScreen.ps1`
- **Added spacing variables** for consistent layout:
  - `$leftMargin = 5` (more space from edges)
  - `$componentSpacing = 2` (between label and input)
  - `$sectionSpacing = 6` (between form sections)
- **Increased content width** to 100 chars max
- **Fixed overlapping** by using Height + spacing for Y positioning
- **Added bottom margin** for status/instructions
- **Result:** No more overlapping text boxes!

## 2. TASK LIST SCREEN - NAVIGATION & TEXT
**File:** `Screens\ASC.002_TaskListScreen.ps1`
- **Made filter box focusable** with `IsFocusable = $true`
- **Fixed help text truncation** - now shows full text:
  "↑↓ Navigate | Enter: Edit | Space: Toggle | N: New | D: Delete"
- **Result:** Tab navigation now works to reach filter box

## 3. THEME SCREEN - PREVIEW & APPLICATION
**File:** `Screens\ASC.003_ThemeScreen.ps1`
- **Fixed preview width** with `[Math]::Max(50, ...)` to prevent truncation
- **Added theme color application** to preview components:
  - Button now shows actual theme button colors
  - List shows actual theme selection colors
- **Increased minimum list width** to 40 chars
- **Result:** Preview shows actual theme colors, no truncation

**File:** `Services\ASE.003_ThemeManager.ps1`
- **Added ConsoleColor to hex conversion** in SetColor()
- **Added forced redraw** with `$global:TuiState.IsDirty = $true`
- **Result:** Themes apply immediately when selected

## KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
1. **Better spacing** - Using consistent spacing variables instead of magic numbers
2. **No more occlusion** - Proper height calculations prevent overlap
3. **Full text visible** - No more "Spa" truncation
4. **Working navigation** - Tab properly cycles through all focusable elements
5. **Themes actually work** - Apply immediately with proper color conversion

## LAYOUT RECOMMENDATION:
The Panel class supports automatic layouts:
- `LayoutType = "Vertical"` - Auto-stack children vertically
- `LayoutType = "Horizontal"` - Auto-stack children horizontally
- `LayoutType = "Grid"` - Grid layout
- `Spacing` property controls space between children

This would eliminate manual positioning entirely for most screens.
