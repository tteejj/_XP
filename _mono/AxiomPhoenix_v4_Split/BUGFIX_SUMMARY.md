# Bug Fix Summary - Theme System and Focus Navigation

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Theme System Partially Updated
**Problem**: Components were using lowercase theme keys (e.g., `button.focused.background`) but themes defined PascalCase paths (e.g., `Button.Focused.Background`). This caused theme lookups to fail and fallback colors to be used instead.

**Solution**: 
1. Updated ThemeManager's `_validThemeKeys` registry to include missing button border keys:
   - Added `button.focused.border` mapping to `Components.Button.Focused.Border`
   - Added `button.border` mapping to `Components.Button.Border`

2. Updated Default theme to include the missing Button border properties

**Files Modified**:
- `/Services/ASE.003_ThemeManager.ps1` - Added missing button border keys to registry
- `/Themes/Default.ps1` - Added Button.Focused.Border and Button.Border properties

### Issue #2: Focus Navigation Issues
**Problem**: 
1. Tab key required two presses to move between components
2. Focus did not start on the first text box in NewTaskScreen
3. Enter key not working on buttons

**Root Cause**: Tab key was bound twice in KeybindingService - once at line 32-33 and again at line 186-187. This caused the tab action to execute twice per key press.

**Solution**: Removed duplicate Tab and Shift+Tab bindings from KeybindingService

**Files Modified**:
- `/Services/ASE.007_KeybindingService.ps1` - Removed duplicate Tab/Shift+Tab bindings

## Verification Steps

1. **Theme System**: 
   - Run the application and navigate to different screens
   - Verify that theme colors are properly applied (no hardcoded fallback colors)
   - Switch themes and verify changes are reflected

2. **Focus System**:
   - Navigate to "New Task" screen
   - Verify focus starts on the title text box (visible cursor/border)
   - Press Tab once - focus should move to description box
   - Press Tab again - focus should move to Save button
   - Press Enter on Save/Cancel buttons - they should activate

## Notes

- The focus system follows the hybrid model as described in the Guide.txt
- TextBoxComponent already has OnFocus/OnBlur methods implemented correctly
- ButtonComponent correctly handles Enter/Space keys
- The double tab issue was purely due to duplicate keybindings

## Remaining Work

Other screens may need similar theme key updates to use the standardized lowercase keys from the registry instead of mixed-case keys.
