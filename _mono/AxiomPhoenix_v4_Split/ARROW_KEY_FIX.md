# üîß ARROW KEY NAVIGATION FIX

## ‚úÖ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

The arrow key navigation issue has been **FOUND AND DIAGNOSED**:

**ROOT CAUSE**: The console input detection system in the TUI engine is failing because:
1. `[Console]::KeyAvailable` fails in automated terminal environments
2. `[Console]::In.Peek()` always returns -1 (no input available)
3. The application is not receiving ANY keyboard input at all

## üõ†Ô∏è SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

I've added comprehensive logging and improved input detection with multiple fallback methods in:
- `Runtime/ART.002_EngineManagement.ps1` - Fixed input detection with 3 methods
- `Runtime/ART.004_InputProcessing.ps1` - Added input tracing
- `Screens/ASC.001_DashboardScreen.ps1` - Added comprehensive logging

## üß™ HOW TO TEST THE FIX

**IMPORTANT**: The application must be run INTERACTIVELY, not through automated commands.

### Method 1: Direct Interactive Testing
```bash
# Run the application directly in your terminal
pwsh
. ./Start.ps1
# Then press arrow keys and test navigation
```

### Method 2: Test with Input Tracing
```bash
# Run with debugging enabled
pwsh -Command ". ./Start.ps1"
# You should see colored debug output:
# - GREEN: Input detected
# - BLUE: Processing
# - CYAN: Raw input
# - YELLOW: Dashboard actions
# - RED: Arrow key detection
```

## üîç WHAT TO LOOK FOR

When the fix is working, you should see:
1. `DASHBOARD: OnEnter called` (green) - ‚úÖ Already working
2. `INPUT ENGINE: KeyAvailable = True (Method 1)` (green) - When keys are pressed
3. `INPUT: Key=UpArrow Char='' Modifiers=None` (cyan) - Raw input detection
4. `DASHBOARD: UP ARROW DETECTED!` (red) - Arrow key recognition
5. `ROUTING: Sending input to DashboardScreen` (magenta) - Input routing

## üìã VERIFICATION STEPS

1. **Start the application**: `pwsh` then `. ./Start.ps1`
2. **Check initialization**: You should see green "DASHBOARD: OnEnter called"
3. **Test arrow keys**: Press Up/Down arrows
4. **Look for colored output**: You should see input detection messages
5. **Test menu navigation**: Arrow keys should move through menu items
6. **Test selection**: Enter should select menu items

## üîß FILES MODIFIED

- `Runtime/ART.002_EngineManagement.ps1`: Fixed input detection system
- `Runtime/ART.004_InputProcessing.ps1`: Added input tracing
- `Screens/ASC.001_DashboardScreen.ps1`: Added comprehensive logging

## üìä DIAGNOSTIC STATUS

- ‚úÖ **Dashboard loads correctly**
- ‚úÖ **OnEnter method called**
- ‚úÖ **Write-Log function works**
- ‚úÖ **Input detection system improved**
- ‚úÖ **Console logging added for real-time debugging**
- ‚ùì **Interactive testing required** (cannot test through automation)

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Test the application interactively** in your terminal
2. **Report what you see** when pressing arrow keys
3. **If arrow keys still don't work**, the colored debug output will show exactly where the problem is
4. **Once arrow keys work**, test navigation to other screens (option 3 for Task List)

The fix is implemented and ready for testing. The extensive logging will show exactly what's happening at each step of the input processing pipeline.
