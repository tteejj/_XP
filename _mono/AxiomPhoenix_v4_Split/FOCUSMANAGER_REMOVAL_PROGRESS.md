# Axiom-Phoenix v4.0 - FocusManager Removal Progress Report
# Date: January 2025

## Summary
The TUI framework has been refactored to use the ncurses window model where each Screen manages its own focus internally. The external FocusManager service has been deprecated and replaced with internal focus tracking.

## Fixed Screens (✅ Complete)

1. **ASC.001_DashboardScreen.ps1** ✅
   - Removed all FocusManager usage
   - Tracks active menu item internally with `$_selectedIndex`
   - Handles all input directly including arrow keys, number keys, and shortcuts
   - Visual focus indicated by color changes

2. **ASC.002_TaskListScreen.ps1** ✅
   - Removed FocusManager dependency
   - Internal `$_activeComponent` tracks "list" or "filter" mode
   - Tab switches between task list and filter box
   - Manual text input handling for filter
   - All CRUD operations work without FocusManager

3. **ASC.003_ThemeScreen.ps1** ✅
   - Direct input handling for theme selection
   - Arrow keys navigate theme list
   - Preview functionality intact
   - No FocusManager needed

4. **ASC.003_ScreenUtilities.ps1** ✅
   - CommandPaletteScreen fixed
   - Internal tracking of "search" vs "list" mode
   - Manual text input for search
   - Tab switches between components

5. **ASC.008_ProjectsListScreen.ps1** ✅
   - Complex screen with search and list
   - Internal `$_activeComponent` for "search" or "list"
   - All project operations work
   - Tab navigation between components

6. **ASC.009_ProjectEditDialog.ps1** ✅
   - Form with multiple fields
   - Tab/Shift+Tab navigation through fields
   - Manual text input for each field
   - Visual focus indicators on active field

## Remaining Screens to Fix (❌ TODO)

1. **ASC.004_NewTaskScreen.ps1** ❌
   - Needs focus management removal
   - Form-based input handling

2. **ASC.005_EditTaskScreen.ps1** ❌
   - Similar to NewTaskScreen
   - Form fields need direct input

3. **ASC.005_FileCommanderScreen.ps1** ❌
   - Complex dual-pane file browser
   - Needs internal pane tracking

4. **ASC.006_TextEditorScreen.ps1** ❌
   - Text editor with complex input
   - Already has sophisticated input handling

5. **ASC.007_ProjectInfoScreen.ps1** ❌
   - Display screen with navigation
   - Simpler fix needed

## Key Patterns Applied

### 1. Internal Focus Tracking
```powershell
hidden [string] $_activeComponent = "main"  # Track which component is active
hidden [int] $_focusIndex = 0              # For lists/forms
```

### 2. Direct Input Handling
```powershell
[bool] HandleInput([System.ConsoleKeyInfo]$keyInfo) {
    if ($null -eq $keyInfo) { return $false }
    
    # Handle based on active component
    if ($this._activeComponent -eq "textbox") {
        # Manual text input
        switch ($keyInfo.Key) {
            ([ConsoleKey]::Backspace) { ... }
            default {
                if ($keyInfo.KeyChar) {
                    $this._textBox.Text += $keyInfo.KeyChar
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return $true  # if handled
}
```

### 3. Visual Focus Indicators
```powershell
hidden [void] _UpdateVisualFocus() {
    if ($this._activeComponent -eq "search") {
        $this._searchBox.ShowCursor = $true
        $this._searchBox.BorderColor = Get-ThemeColor "primary.accent"
    } else {
        $this._searchBox.ShowCursor = $false
        $this._searchBox.BorderColor = Get-ThemeColor "border"
    }
}
```

### 4. Component Settings
```powershell
$component.IsFocusable = $false  # ALWAYS set this
$component.ShowCursor = $true    # Only when active
```

## Services Status

1. **FocusManager Service** (ASE.006_FocusManager.ps1)
   - Replaced with stub that logs deprecation warnings
   - Prevents errors during transition
   - Should be removed completely once all screens are fixed

2. **Screen Base Class** (ABC.006_Screen.ps1)
   - Already has ncurses-style focus management built in
   - Methods: SetChildFocus, FocusNextChild, etc.
   - Screens can use these OR implement their own

## Testing Checklist for Each Screen

- [ ] All keyboard shortcuts work
- [ ] Tab navigation functions properly
- [ ] Text input works in all fields
- [ ] Visual focus indicators update
- [ ] No FocusManager errors in logs
- [ ] Escape key goes back
- [ ] Enter key submits/selects

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining screens (ASC.004, 005, 006, 007)
2. Remove FocusManager registration from Start.ps1
3. Delete stub FocusManager service
4. Update documentation
5. Comprehensive testing of all screens

## Notes

- The ncurses model is more robust and predictable
- Each screen has complete control over its input
- No external service dependencies for basic UI operations
- Better performance with less indirection
- Easier to debug input issues
