### RECOMMENDATION 1: Enhance PmcProject Class
```powershell
# Add these fields to Models/AMO.003_CoreModelClasses.ps1
[string]$ID1                         # Generic Project/time code
[string]$ID2                         # unique project id
[string]$Contact                     # Primary contact person
[string]$contact phone				 # primary contact phone#
[string]$CaaFileName                 # CAA file reference
[string]$RequestFileName             # Request file reference
[string]$T2020FileName              # T2020 file reference
[string]$ProjFolder                  # Project folder path

## USER INTERFACE & EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS

### Dashboard Design Patterns
The legacy system features a sophisticated dashboard with:

**Enhanced Project Overview:**
- Multi-column layouts with smart column sizing
- Row highlighting for overdue/due-soon projects
- Latest todo preview in dashboard
- Hours tracking integration in main view


**Table Configuration System:**
```powershell
# Current system lacks this sophisticated table management
$global:tableConfig = @{
    Columns = @{
        Dashboard = @(
            @{Title="#"; Width=3}, 
            @{Title="ID2"; Width=10}, 
            @{Title="Name"; Width=60}, 
            @{Title="BF Date"; Width=10}, 
            @{Title="Latest Todo"; Width=42}
        )
        ProjectInfoDetail = @(
            @{Title="Field"; Width=15}, 
            @{Title="Value"; Width=55}
        )
        # ... more specialized views
    }
}
```

### RECOMMENDATION 2: Enhanced Dashboard System
1. **Implement configurable table layouts** - Dynamic column sizing based on content

- Date range filtering and reporting
- Integration with external timesheet systems - through export to clipboard/csv

### RECOMMENDATION 3: Timesheet System Improvements
1. **Add CSV import/export functionality** to TimeSheetService
2. **Implement non-project time tracking** - meetings, admin tasks, etc. - by id1 identifiers
3. **Enhanced reporting** - Custom date ranges, export formats

allow entry of strings 
these are stored with a short description and optional tags
commandpalette type retrieval would be great, not sure how best to organize that
when selected, command string is copied to the clipboard so user can paste where needed


### RECOMMENDATION 4: Specialized Screen Components
1. **ProjectDetailScreen** - Comprehensive project view with editing
2. **WizardScreen** - Multi-step process support - for entry of new projects, time, or...
3. **FileBrowserComponent** - Enhanced file management - also integrated where needed - project entry, others??
4. **CommandPaletteScreen** - command screen
