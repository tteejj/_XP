I have a large, modular Tui PowerShell program. We are reviewing it module by module for errors. We will follow a set procedure. 

1. Read the "__Guide.txt" file. It has important information about how the program works and the rules it must follow.

2. Review the following file for the following rule infractions.

3. Edit the file directly. Don't rewrite the whole file if possible. 

3A. Ensure edits do not introduce corruption or errors into the file. 

4. Fix only the items requested.
