# Application Startup Failure Diagnosis

## Issue Summary
The application fails to start due to type resolution errors in the screen components.

## Root Cause
The screens are trying to use `[Label]` type, but the actual class name is `[LabelComponent]`.

### Error Details
1. **Primary Error**: 
   - Location: `/home/teej/projects/github/_XP/_mono/AxiomPhoenix_v4_Split/Screens/ASC.001_DashboardScreen.ps1:32`
   - Error: `Unable to find type [Label]`
   - Code: `$this._titleLabel = [Label]::new("TitleLabel")`

2. **Secondary Error**:
   - Location: `/home/teej/projects/github/_XP/_mono/AxiomPhoenix_v4_Split/Screens/ASC.001_DashboardScreen.ps1:99`
   - Error: `Unable to find type [TaskListScreen]`
   - Note: This error occurs because the script execution stops after the first error

## Files Affected
1. `Screens/ASC.001_DashboardScreen.ps1` - Line 32
2. `Screens/ASC.002_TaskListScreen.ps1` - Line 36 (also uses `[Label]`)

## Solution
Replace all instances of `[Label]` with `[LabelComponent]` in the affected files.

## Verification Steps
1. Fix the type references in the screen files
2. Run the application again using `./Start.ps1`
3. Check the debug log for any remaining errors

## Additional Notes
- The actual component class is defined in `Components/ACO.001_LabelComponent.ps1`
- The class is properly named `LabelComponent` and extends `UIElement`
- This appears to be a simple naming inconsistency issue

## Resolution Status: FIXED âœ“

### Changes Made:
1. Fixed `ASC.001_DashboardScreen.ps1` line 32: Changed `[Label]` to `[LabelComponent]`
2. Fixed `ASC.002_TaskListScreen.ps1` line 36: Changed `[Label]` to `[LabelComponent]`
3. Fixed forward reference issues:
   - `ASC.001_DashboardScreen.ps1` line 99-107: Changed direct type reference to dynamic object creation
   - `ASC.002_TaskListScreen.ps1` line 208-214: Changed direct type reference to dynamic object creation

### Current Status:
- Application now starts successfully
- All screens load without errors
- The TUI interface is being rendered (application runs in terminal mode)
- Debug log shows successful initialization of all services
