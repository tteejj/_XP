HOLISTIC INPUT ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS
Looking at successful TUI frameworks reveals our core problems:
NCURSES PATTERN

Single focused window gets ALL input
Modal = top window captures everything
No complex routing - just "who's on top?"

GUI.CS PATTERN

Clear hierarchy: Application → Modal → Window → View
Input flows DOWN to focused view
Returns bubble UP if not handled
Modal dialogs create a new input "scope"

LANTERNA PATTERN

WindowManager owns focus AND z-order together
Input thread separate from render
Modal windows get exclusive input pump

AXIOM-PHOENIX PROBLEMS
1. SPLIT BRAIN ARCHITECTURE

FocusManager tracks focus
DialogManager tracks overlays
Process-TuiInput tries to coordinate both
No single source of truth for "who gets input"

2. CONFLICTING HIERARCHIES

Render hierarchy (parent/child)
Focus hierarchy (what's focusable)
Z-order (overlays)
These don't align!

3. MODAL IS BROKEN
Current "modal" just adds to overlay stack but doesn't create an input scope. Input can still leak through.
PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE
Option 1: UNIFIED INPUT MANAGER
InputManager {
    - Owns focus tracking
    - Owns modal stack
    - Single ProcessInput() method
    - Returns InputContext with:
      - Current modal scope
      - Focused element in that scope
      - Z-ordered list of candidates
}
Option 2: WINDOW-BASED MODEL
Like gui.cs:

Screen = Window
Dialog = Modal Window
Only ONE window active at a time
Modal windows completely replace input context

Option 3: LAYER-BASED INPUT
InputLayers [
    0: Base Screen
    1: Floating panels
    2: Modal dialogs
    3: System overlays (command palette)
]
Each layer blocks all layers below when active.
Which direction makes sense for fixing this properly?JHLet's evaluate your proposed options in the context of your specific program and the PowerShell environment.
Evaluation of Proposed Architectures
Option 2: Window-Based Model (Like gui.cs)
* Pros: This is a very robust and well-understood pattern. It's conceptually simple: only one "window" (be it a Screen or a Dialog) is ever the active recipient of input. It creates an ironclad modal system.
* Cons: It can be rigid. It doesn't easily accommodate non-modal "tool windows" or floating panels that might be desirable later. Every pop-up must be strictly modal.
* PowerShell Fit: Good. The concept of swapping out the entire input context fits well with a single-threaded scripting environment. It's less complex to manage than multiple active layers.
Option 3: Layer-Based Input
* Pros: Extremely powerful and flexible. It allows for complex UIs with multiple, potentially overlapping, non-modal elements. It's how modern graphical OS window managers think.
* Cons: Overkill and Overly Complex for PowerShell. Managing these layers, propagating input through them, and handling focus scopes within each layer is a significant engineering challenge. It requires a very mature component model and state management system that is difficult to implement correctly in a single-threaded scripting environment like PowerShell. This path leads to the very "Split Brain" problem you identified if not executed perfectly.
* PowerShell Fit: Poor. This pattern is best suited for compiled, multi-threaded languages with mature UI frameworks (WPF, WinForms, Qt, etc.).
Option 1: Unified Input Manager
* Pros: This is the "Goldilocks" solution. It is a pragmatic compromise that directly addresses your diagnosed problems without requiring a total rewrite of the component model. It unifies the "split brain" into a single source of truth.
* Cons: It requires creating a new InputManager service and refactoring the responsibilities of FocusManager and DialogManager into it.
* PowerShell Fit: Excellent. It creates a single, authoritative service that can be managed cleanly within the existing ServiceContainer. It centralizes the complex logic into one place, making the main application loop (Process-TuiInput) incredibly simple and declarative. It's a "PowerShell-friendly" way to manage a complex C#-style pattern.    ###SO I DONT KNOW. I AM NOT A CODER. I NEED ADVICE HERE. WHICH OF THESE, OR YOURS OR OTHERS MAKES SENSE HERE? SIMPLE/ROBUST AND GUARANTEED TO WORK ARE PREFERRED. I NEED THIS TO WORK.Thought process6sThe user is asking for advice on which approach to take. They're not a coder and need something simple, robust, and guaranteed to work. They're frustrated with the current broken state.
Looking at this pragmatically:

Option 2 (Window-Based) is the simplest and most proven
Option 1 (Unified Input Manager) is more flexible but requires more refactoring
Option 3 (Layer-Based) is overkill

Given their requirements:

Simple
Robust
Guaranteed to work
They're not a coder

I should recommend Option 2 (Window-Based Model) because:

It's the simplest conceptually
It's proven in gui.cs
It requires the least architectural change
It will definitely work
It's easy to understand

The key insight is that they just want it to work. They don't need flexibility for future features they may never build. They need a working TUI now.MY RECOMMENDATION: Option 2 - Window-Based Model
Here's why this is the RIGHT choice for you:
IT'S SIMPLE

One window active at a time
Modal dialogs completely take over
No complex routing logic
No ambiguity about who gets input

IT'S PROVEN

gui.cs uses this successfully
Terminal.Gui (the .NET version) uses it
Turbo Vision (DOS era) used it
It just works

MINIMAL CHANGES NEEDED

NavigationService already manages screens (windows)
DialogManager becomes simpler - just swaps the active window
Process-TuiInput becomes trivial:
powershell$activeWindow = $global:TuiState.ActiveWindow
if ($activeWindow.HandleInput($keyInfo)) { return }


HOW IT WORKS

Screen = Normal window (Dashboard, TaskList)
Dialog = Modal window (CommandPalette, Alerts)
Only ONE is active - no confusion
When you open CommandPalette:

It becomes the ONLY active window
Screen below is "paused"
ALL input goes to CommandPalette
When closed, previous screen resumes



FIXES ALL YOUR ISSUES

Dashboard keys will work (it's the only active window)
CommandPalette text input will work (it gets ALL keys)
No focus confusion (active window manages its own focus)
No z-order issues (only one window visible)

IMPLEMENTATION PATH

Merge ActiveWindow tracking into NavigationService
Make Dialog inherit from Screen (they're both windows)
Simplify Process-TuiInput to just route to ActiveWindow
Remove overlay complexity

This is battle-tested simplicity. It WILL work.
Should I implement this?
