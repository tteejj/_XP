1.Of course. You are correct. A concise overview of the code-level changes is more effective. Here is the summary of the required implementation, broken down by file and the logic behind each change.

This is the implementation plan to fix the architecture and make the command palette functional.

Step 1: Refactor Core Services (AllServices.ps1)

The goal here is to eliminate redundancy, fix the architectural pattern for overlays, and update the action that triggers the command palette.

CommandPaletteManager Class:

Change: Delete the entire class CommandPaletteManager.

Logic: This service is an unnecessary layer. The DialogManager is the single, correct service for managing all overlays, including the command palette. Removing this simplifies the architecture and eliminates a source of confusion.

DialogManager Class:

Change: Add a new hidden property: hidden [UIElement]$_previousFocus = $null.

Logic: This allows the DialogManager to remember what the user was doing before an overlay appeared.

Change: Modify ShowDialog(). Before showing a dialog, it will execute: $this._previousFocus = $this.FocusManager.FocusedComponent.

Change: Modify HideDialog(). Before exiting, it will execute: $this.FocusManager.SetFocus($this._previousFocus).

Logic: This implements seamless focus restoration, a critical user experience improvement. The application will now feel intuitive, returning the user's cursor to where it was.

TuiFrameworkService Class:

Change: Delete the methods GetService, GetServices, GetCommandPalette, and SetFocusedComponent.

Logic (Pillar 4): This enforces the architectural guide. The TuiFrameworkService's sole purpose is to provide a safe API to the TUI's runtime state (like buffer dimensions and the overlay stack), not to act as a second, competing service container.

ActionService Class:

Change: Rewrite the scriptblock for the "app.commandPalette" action.

Logic (Pillar 1 & 2): Instead of calling a manager, the action now correctly orchestrates the creation and display of the palette UI, following the "Data Down, Events Up" pattern.

It will get the DialogManager and ActionService from $global:TuiState.Services.

It will instantiate the CommandPalette component: $palette = [CommandPalette]::new(...).

It will populate the palette with data: $palette.SetActions(...).

It will define what happens when the user selects a command: $palette.OnExecute = { ... }.

It will use the standard overlay mechanism: $dialogManager.ShowDialog($palette).

Step 2: Implement the CommandPalette Component (AllComponents.ps1)

The goal is to create the missing UI component that was causing the crash, following the guide's rules for components.

CommandPalette Class:

Change: Add a new class CommandPalette : UIElement.

Logic (Pillar 1): This class will be a "dumb" UI container.

Internal Components: It will contain a hidden [TextBoxComponent]$_searchBox and a hidden [ListBox]$_listBox.

Data Handling: It will have a public method SetActions([object[]]$actions) to receive the list of commands to display. It will contain the logic to filter the ListBox based on text entered into its _searchBox.

Event Handling: It will have a public event property [scriptblock]$OnExecute. When the user presses Enter on a ListBox item, it will invoke this scriptblock, passing the selected action's name back up.

Input Handling: Its HandleInput method will manage user interaction within the componentâ€”switching focus between the textbox and listbox, handling up/down arrows for selection, etc.

Step 3: Correct Application Startup (Start.ps1)

The goal is to fix the fatal dependency crash and make the startup sequence logical and robust.

Service Registration:

Change: Delete the entire registration block for CommandPaletteManager. It no longer exists.

Change: Re-order all service registrations to follow an explicit dependency hierarchy. Services with no dependencies (Logger, EventManager) are registered first, and services that depend on them (ActionService, FocusManager) are registered next, and so on.

Logic: This makes the startup process resilient and easy to understand, preventing future dependency-related crashes.

Step 4: Fix the Runtime Input Loop (AllRuntime.ps1)

The goal is to replace the broken, over-engineered input function with a simple, correct, and debuggable one.

Process-TuiInput Function:

Change: Replace the entire body of the function Process-TuiInput.

Logic: The new implementation will be clean and follow a strict, non-negotiable priority order for input handling:

Focused Component First: The component that FocusManager says has focus gets the first chance to handle the key. If it does, the cycle ends.

Active Overlay (Modality): If there is an overlay on screen (like the command palette), it gets the next chance. If it handles the key, the cycle ends. Input is not passed to the screen underneath, enforcing modal behavior.

Global Keybindings: If the key was not handled, KeybindingService checks if it matches a global hotkey (like Ctrl+P).

Current Screen: If all else fails, the base screen gets a final chance to process the input.


2. TaskListScreen Performance and Design

My assumption about the inefficient rendering loop was absolutely correct.

Code-Level Evidence:

File: AllScreens.ps1 (ASC.002)

Method: _UpdateTaskList()

Lines:

$panel.Children.Clear()

for ($i = 0; $i -lt $this._tasks.Count; $i++) { ... }

$taskPanel = [Panel]::new("TaskItem_$($task.Id)")

$taskLabel = [LabelComponent]::new("TaskLabel_$($task.Id)")

$panel.AddChild($taskPanel)

Analysis: This confirms the creation of two new UIElement objects for every task, every single time the list is filtered or a selection changes. For a list of 200 tasks, this is 400 object instantiations and subsequent garbage collections on every interaction, which is a major performance killer.

Step-by-Step Refactoring Plan:

Change the Component: In TaskListScreen, replace the [ScrollablePanel] $_taskListPanel with a [Table] $_taskTable. The Table component (ACO.010) is already designed for virtualized data display.

Update Initialize(): Change the initialization logic in TaskListScreen.Initialize().

Generated powershell
# In TaskListScreen.Initialize()

# ...
# REMOVE the ScrollablePanel creation.
# ADD the Table creation:
$listWidth = [Math]::Floor($this.Width * 0.6)
$this._taskTable = [Table]::new("TasksTable")
$this._taskTable.X = 1
$this._taskTable.Y = 4
$this._taskTable.Width = $listWidth
$this._taskTable.Height = $this.Height - 8
$this._taskTable.ShowHeader = $true
$this._taskTable.AllowSelection = $true
$this._taskTable.SetColumns(@("Status", "P", "Title", "Progress")) # Define columns
# You can customize widths:
$this._taskTable.ColumnWidths["Status"] = 8
$this._taskTable.ColumnWidths["P"] = 3
$this._taskTable.ColumnWidths["Title"] = 40
$this._taskTable.ColumnWidths["Progress"] = 10

$thisScreen = $this
$this._taskTable.OnSelectionChanged = {
    param($sender, $newIndex)
    $thisScreen._selectedIndex = $newIndex
    if ($thisScreen._tasks.Count -gt 0) {
        $thisScreen._selectedTask = $thisScreen._tasks[$newIndex]
    }
    $thisScreen._UpdateDetailPanel() # Only need to update the details
    $thisScreen.RequestRedraw()
}.GetNewClosure()

$this._mainPanel.AddChild($this._taskTable)
# ...

Rewrite _UpdateTaskList(): This method becomes incredibly simple. Instead of building UI, you just format data.

Generated powershell
# In TaskListScreen
hidden [void] _UpdateTaskList() {
    if (-not $this._taskTable) { return }

    # Format the PmcTask objects into PSCustomObjects that the Table can display
    $displayItems = [System.Collections.Generic.List[PSObject]]::new()
    foreach($task in $this._tasks) {
        $displayItems.Add([PSCustomObject]@{
            Status = $task.Status.ToString()
            P = switch ($task.Priority) {
                ([TaskPriority]::Low) { "v" }
                ([TaskPriority]::Medium) { "-" }
                ([TaskPriority]::High) { "^" }
            }
            Title = $task.Title
            Progress = "$($task.Progress)%"
            # Add a hidden property to link back to the original object if needed
            __TaskObject = $task
        })
    }

    # Just update the table's data source. The table handles the rest.
    $this._taskTable.Items = $displayItems
    $this._taskTable.SelectedIndex = $this._selectedIndex
    $this._taskTable.RequestRedraw()
}

Adapt HandleInput(): The Table component has its own built-in navigation (UpArrow, DownArrow, etc.). You can remove this logic from TaskListScreen.HandleInput and let the focused Table component manage its own selection. The OnSelectionChanged scriptblock will keep the screen's state in sync.

3. Hardcoded Hotkeys vs. Action Service

The initial assessment was correct. The screen handles input that should be managed globally.

Code-Level Evidence:

File: AllScreens.ps1 (ASC.002)

Method: HandleInput()

Lines: Cases for [ConsoleKey]::N, [ConsoleKey]::E, [ConsoleKey]::D, [ConsoleKey]::C directly call button OnClick handlers.

Analysis: This prevents remapping keys and makes it impossible to trigger these actions from the CommandPalette.

Step-by-Step Refactoring Plan:

Remove Hotkey Logic from Screen: Delete the N, E, D, C cases from TaskListScreen.HandleInput(). The screen should only handle contextual input like Up/Down arrow for list navigation if it's not using a component that handles it already (like the Table).

Ensure Actions Exist: Verify the actions are registered in ActionService.RegisterDefaultActions() (ASE.001). The existing "task.new" is a good example. Add new ones for edit and delete.

Generated powershell
# In ActionService.RegisterDefaultActions()
$this.RegisterAction("task.edit.selected", {
    $navService = $global:TuiState.Services.NavigationService
    if ($navService.CurrentScreen -is [TaskListScreen]) {
        # This is a safe way to call a method on the screen
        $navService.CurrentScreen._editButton.OnClick.Invoke()
    }
}, @{ Category = "Tasks"; Description = "Edit selected task" })

# ... similar action for "task.delete.selected" ...

Map Keys in KeybindingService: In KeybindingService._InitializeDefaultBindings() (ASE.002), map the keys to the actions.

Generated powershell
# In KeybindingService._InitializeDefaultBindings()
# Create a new context for the TaskList screen
$this.SetBinding("N", "task.new", "TaskList")
$this.SetBinding("E", "task.edit.selected", "TaskList")
$this.SetBinding("D", "task.delete.selected", "TaskList")

Use the Context: In TaskListScreen, you would push/pop this context.

Generated powershell
# In TaskListScreen.OnEnter()
$keybindingService = $this.ServiceContainer.GetService("KeybindingService")
$keybindingService.PushContext($keybindingService.KeyMap["TaskList"])

# In TaskListScreen.OnExit()
$keybindingService = $this.ServiceContainer.GetService("KeybindingService")
$keybindingService.PopContext()

Use code with caution.
Powershell
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This creates a clean, context-aware input system that is configurable and decoupled.

Final Assessment and Path Forward

You have a powerful, well-structured rendering engine and service layer. The primary task now is enforcing your own architecture. The "Now" problems are all instances where components or screens have broken the established rules.

By implementing the detailed refactoring plans above, you will:

Fix Critical Bugs: The CommandPalette refactoring will eliminate a major source of focus and rendering conflicts.

Boost Performance: The TaskListScreen refactoring will make the UI dramatically more responsive with large data sets.

Improve Maintainability: Decoupling hotkeys and enforcing service-based state management will make the code easier to understand, test, and extend.

Your base is more than just salvageable; it's excellent. The next step is disciplined adherence to the patterns you've already established. Complete these refactoring steps, and you will have the stable, professional-grade foundation you're looking for.
