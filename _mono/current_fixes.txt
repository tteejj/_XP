This is an impressive and comprehensive Text User Interface (TUI) framework built entirely in PowerShell! The design follows common UI patterns (components, screens, services, eventing, dirty rendering, double-buffering, Z-indexing, dependency injection) and demonstrates a deep understanding of PowerShell classes and console manipulation.

However, after reviewing the entire program, I've identified several areas that could lead to issues, from minor inefficiencies to critical bugs.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

---

### Critical Issues (Likely to cause bugs or incorrect behavior)

1.  **Duplicate `Write-TuiBox` Function Definition:**
    *   **Location:** `AllFunctions.ps1` (lines 14-87 and lines 90-165).
    *   **Problem:** The function `Write-TuiBox` is defined twice in the same file. PowerShell will simply use the *last* definition encountered. While the two definitions are similar, they are not identical. For instance, the first one uses `ForegroundColor` for the fill cell, while the second uses `BorderColor`. This is highly confusing and prone to subtle bugs.
    *   **Impact:** Unpredictable behavior for calls to `Write-TuiBox`, potential for unexpected colors or rendering.
    *   **Recommendation:** Remove one of the definitions. Consolidate their logic into a single, robust function that uses the correct parameters and logic.

2.  **`Write-TuiText` Style Parameters Not Propagated:**
    *   **Location:** `AllFunctions.ps1` (`Write-TuiText` function, lines 89-130).
    *   **Problem:** `Write-TuiText` accepts `$Bold`, `$Underline`, `$Italic`, `$ZIndex` but calls `Buffer.WriteString` which only takes `$char`, `$fg`, `$bg`. The `TuiCell` constructor called by `WriteString` therefore only uses `char`, `fg`, `bg` and defaults the other style properties.
    *   **Impact:** Text rendered using `Write-TuiText` will not display bold, underline, or italic styles, and `ZIndex` will always be 0, regardless of the parameters passed to the function.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Modify `TuiBuffer.WriteString` to accept `[bool]$bold`, `[bool]$underline`, `[bool]$italic`, `[int]$zIndex` parameters.
        *   Update `TuiBuffer.WriteString` to pass these parameters to the `TuiCell` constructor.
        *   Update `Write-TuiText` to pass its received style parameters to the new `TuiBuffer.WriteString` signature.

3.  **`ScrollablePanel` Virtual Scrolling Incomplete:**
    *   **Location:** `ScrollablePanel` class (`UpdateChildrenPositions` method, lines 1058-1061).
    *   **Problem:** The `UpdateChildrenPositions` method is explicitly called by `HandleInput` but is an *empty* method. The virtual scrolling logic requires that the rendered `Y` position of child elements within the panel be adjusted by `-$this.ScrollOffsetY` when they are blended onto the `_private_buffer`. Currently, `UIElement._RenderContent` (which `Panel` and `ScrollablePanel` inherit from) calls `this._private_buffer.BlendBuffer($child._private_buffer, $child.X, $child.Y)`, using the child's *fixed* `Y` position.
    *   **Impact:** When a user scrolls in a `ScrollablePanel`, the content will not actually move vertically. The scrollbar might move, but the visible components will remain static.
    *   **Recommendation:** The `ScrollablePanel` needs to override `_RenderContent` from `UIElement`. Inside this override, when it iterates through its children, it must modify the `Y` coordinate passed to `BlendBuffer` to account for `ScrollOffsetY`. For example:
        ```powershell
        hidden [void] _RenderContent() {
            # ... (base OnRender logic, clearing buffer, drawing border)

            # Manually render children, applying scroll offset
            foreach ($child in $this.Children | Sort-Object ZIndex) {
                if ($child.Visible) {
                    $child.Render() # This renders child to its own buffer
                    if ($null -ne $child._private_buffer) {
                        # Apply scroll offset to child's Y position when blending
                        $blendedY = $child.Y - $this.ScrollOffsetY
                        # Ensure blend is within this panel's content area
                        # ... (add logic to clip blend area to panel's ContentX/Y/Width/Height)
                        $this._private_buffer.BlendBuffer($child._private_buffer, $child.X, $blendedY)
                    }
                }
            }
            $this._needs_redraw = $false
        }
        ```
        And `ScrollablePanel.OnRender` should then just update the scrollbar and `MaxScrollY` and call `([Panel]$this).OnRender()` (which in turn should call the new `_RenderContent` logic if it's an override).

4.  **Inconsistent Screen Stack Management & Redundancy:**
    *   **Location:** `AllRuntime.ps1` (`Push-Screen`, `Pop-Screen`, `Switch-Screen`) and `AllServices.ps1` (`NavigationService`).
    *   **Problem:** There are *two* separate mechanisms for managing the screen stack:
        *   `$global:TuiState.ScreenStack` (a plain PowerShell array) is manipulated by `Push-Screen`, `Pop-Screen`, `Switch-Screen`.
        *   `NavigationService.NavigationStack` (`System.Collections.Generic.Stack[Screen]`) is manipulated by `NavigationService.NavigateTo` and `NavigationService.GoBack`.
    *   Both sets of functions update `$global:TuiState.CurrentScreen` and call lifecycle methods. This duplication is a major architectural flaw. The plain array operations (`+=`, `[-1]`, slicing) are also inefficient for stack operations (O(N) for push/pop).
    *   **Impact:** Confusion, potential for desynchronized state between the two "stacks," leading to incorrect screen transitions or lifecycle calls. Inefficiency for stack operations.
    *   **Recommendation:** Centralize all screen navigation through the `NavigationService`. Remove `Push-Screen`, `Pop-Screen`, `Switch-Screen` from `AllRuntime.ps1`. The `Start-AxiomPhoenix` function should *only* interact with `NavigationService` to set the initial screen. The `NavigationService` already correctly updates `$global:TuiState.CurrentScreen`.

### Major Issues (Design/Robustness concerns)

5.  **`TextBox.Focus()` uses Undeclared `_focusManager`:**
    *   **Location:** `TextBox` class (`Focus` method, lines 1221-1223).
    *   **Problem:** The code `$this.Parent._focusManager.SetFocus($this)` assumes a `_focusManager` property exists on the parent, which is typically a `Screen` or `Panel`. However, no `_focusManager` property is declared or initialized on `UIElement`, `Component`, `Panel`, or `Screen`.
    *   **Impact:** This line will throw an error (`"You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression."`) when `Focus()` is called. Focus management will not work.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a dedicated `FocusManager` service. This service would track the currently focused component, handle `Tab` navigation, and manage `IsFocused`/`OnFocus`/`OnBlur` states across the UI tree. The `Set-ComponentFocus` function already attempts to do some of this logic, but it's a global function that doesn't belong within a component's method. The `FocusManager` service should be registered with the `ServiceContainer` and components needing focus control should retrieve it.

6.  **`DataManager` Fragile JSON Deserialization:**
    *   **Location:** `DataManager` class (`LoadData` method, lines 2055-2101).
    *   **Problem:** The `LoadData` method manually iterates through properties of the deserialized hashtable (`$taskData.GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object { if ($task.PSObject.Properties.Match($_.Name)) { $task.($_.Name) = $_.Value } }`). While this works for simple properties, it's brittle. If a property name changes, or if complex nested objects (e.g., a `PmcTask` having a custom complex type property) are introduced, this manual mapping can fail or lead to data inconsistencies. PowerShell's `ConvertFrom-Json` doesn't automatically hydrate custom classes without more advanced techniques.
    *   **Impact:** Future changes to model classes might break data loading.
    *   **Recommendation:** For robust custom type deserialization in PowerShell, you generally need to implement custom type converters or use an external library like Json.NET via `Add-Type`. For this scope, it might be acceptable, but it's a known pain point. A simpler improvement would be to check the *type* of the property and cast if necessary, e.g., `[datetime]$_.Value`.

7.  **`ComboBoxComponent` Dropdown Not a True Overlay:**
    *   **Location:** `ComboBoxComponent` (`OnRender`, `DrawDropdown`, lines 1350-1473).
    *   **Problem:** The `ComboBoxComponent` sets `IsOverlay = $true` when its dropdown is open, which suggests it should be rendered on the global overlay stack. However, `DrawDropdown` directly draws onto the `ComboBoxComponent`'s *own* `_private_buffer` at `($dropX + $x, $dropY + $y)`, where `$dropY` is `$this.Height` relative to the combobox's own bounds. This means the combobox's `_private_buffer` grows to accommodate the dropdown, and it's still blended into its parent like a normal child, not as a separate, top-level overlay. `Invoke-TuiRender` specifically handles the `$global:TuiState.CommandPalette` and `OverlayStack` for true overlays.
    *   **Impact:** The combobox dropdown will be clipped by its parent's boundaries and won't truly overlay elements outside of its parent. It might also cause rendering artifacts if the parent's background is not fully opaque or if the combobox's `_private_buffer` needs to be significantly larger than its declared `Width`/`Height`.
    *   **Recommendation:** For a true global overlay, the combobox dropdown should be a *separate* `UIElement` instance (e.g., a `ListBox` instance) that is dynamically added to `$global:TuiState.OverlayStack` when the dropdown opens, and removed when it closes. The combobox itself would then only render its main input area. This would allow the dropdown to appear on top of *any* other UI elements.

### Minor Issues (Improvements, inconsistencies, or potential edge cases)

8.  **`TuiBuffer.WriteString` Lacks Full `TuiCell` Parameters:**
    *   **Location:** `TuiBuffer` class (`WriteString` method, lines 177-189).
    *   **Problem:** `WriteString` only allows specifying `char`, `fg`, `bg`. It always creates a `TuiCell` with `Bold=$false`, `Underline=$false`, `Italic=$false`, `ZIndex=0`. This limits its utility for drawing rich text without manually calling `SetCell` for each character.
    *   **Impact:** Text drawn via `WriteString` or `DrawText` (its alias) will always be unformatted unless `SetCell` is used character by character.
    *   **Recommendation:** Update `TuiBuffer.WriteString` to accept optional `Bold`, `Underline`, `Italic`, `ZIndex` parameters and pass them through to `TuiCell::new`.

9.  **`TuiAnsiHelper` Caches for Single-Threaded Use:**
    *   **Location:** `TuiAnsiHelper` class (`_fgCache`, `_bgCache`, lines 21-22).
    *   **Problem:** Uses `ConcurrentDictionary` for caches. While technically harmless, PowerShell's main TUI loop is generally single-threaded, so a regular `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary` would be sufficient and marginally more performant (without locking overhead).
    *   **Impact:** Negligible overhead.
    *   **Recommendation:** Could simplify to `[System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[string, string]]::new()`.

10. **`KeybindingService.GlobalHandlers` Unused:**
    *   **Location:** `KeybindingService` class (lines 2017, 2095-2101).
    *   **Problem:** The `GlobalHandlers` hashtable is declared, and `RegisterGlobalHandler`/`UnregisterGlobalHandler` methods exist, but the `Process-TuiInput` function (or any other part of the framework) does not seem to iterate or invoke these handlers.
    *   **Impact:** This feature is currently not functional.
    *   **Recommendation:** Either remove this functionality if it's not needed, or integrate it into the input processing loop.

11. **`$global:TuiState.ScreenStack` and `OverlayStack` as Plain Arrays:**
    *   **Location:** `AllRuntime.ps1` (e.g., `Push-Screen`, `Pop-Screen`, `Show-TuiOverlay`, `Close-TopTuiOverlay`).
    *   **Problem:** These variables are manipulated as PowerShell arrays, simulating stack behavior (`+=`, `[-1]`, slicing). While functional, using `System.Collections.Generic.Stack[T]` (as is correctly done for `NavigationService.NavigationStack`) is more efficient for stack operations (O(1) vs. O(N) for array manipulation) and semantically clearer.
    *   **Impact:** Minor performance overhead for frequent push/pop operations, especially with many screens/overlays.
    *   **Recommendation:** Convert `$global:TuiState.ScreenStack` to `[System.Collections.Generic.Stack[Screen]]::new()` and `$global:TuiState.OverlayStack` to `[System.Collections.Generic.Stack[UIElement]]::new()`, and update all relevant push/pop logic to use the `Push()`, `Pop()`, `Peek()`, and `Count` methods of the generic stack.

12. **`UIElement._private_buffer` Initialization in Constructor:**
    *   **Location:** `UIElement` class (constructors, lines 347, 355, 363).
    *   **Problem:** The `[TuiBuffer]::new($this.Width, $this.Height, "$($this.Name).Buffer")` call in constructors uses `$this.Width` and `$this.Height`. If the constructor doesn't explicitly set them (e.g., `UIElement()`), they will be the default values (10, 3). This is usually fine as `Resize` will be called later, but it's worth noting.
    *   **Impact:** Initial buffer size might be small, immediately requiring a resize.
    *   **Recommendation:** No critical action needed, as `Resize` handles it, but it's a minor point of awareness.

13. **Console Write-Verbose in Debug/Warning:**
    *   **Location:** Throughout the code, particularly in `AllBaseClasses.ps1` and `AllRuntime.ps1`.
    *   **Problem:** Many `Write-Verbose` and `Write-Warning` calls are present within core rendering and input loops. While helpful for debugging, they can slow down performance significantly if `$VerbosePreference` is `Continue`. The script sets `$script:TuiVerbosePreference = 'SilentlyContinue'`, but global preferences or debug scripts can override this.
    *   **Impact:** Performance degradation if verbosity is enabled during runtime.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use a dedicated logging service (like the provided `Logger` class) for internal verbose messages instead of `Write-Verbose`. This allows fine-grained control over logging without interfering with PowerShell's built-in verbosity stream. The `Write-Log` function is already provided for this purpose.

14. **`ServiceInitializationException` in `Screen` Constructor:**
    *   **Location:** `Screen` class (`Screen([string]$name, [object]$serviceContainer)` constructor, lines 597-611).
    *   **Problem:** The code catches an exception when trying to enumerate services from the `ServiceContainer` and writes a warning. If `GetAllRegisteredServices` or `GetService` throws a critical error during initialization, this might be better handled by re-throwing a `ServiceInitializationException` to signal a fatal setup issue rather than continuing with potentially missing services.
    *   **Impact:** Suppressed errors during service population could lead to later `null` reference errors when services are attempted to be used.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider re-throwing the exception, perhaps wrapped in `ServiceInitializationException`, if the failure to get services is critical for the screen's operation.

### Overall Assessment

The framework is ambitious and well-structured, showcasing significant effort and understanding of building complex applications in PowerShell. The core concepts like `TuiCell`, `TuiBuffer`, differential rendering, and the service-oriented architecture are excellent.

The critical issues highlighted above, especially the dual screen stacks, the broken `ScrollablePanel` scrolling, and the duplicate `Write-TuiBox` function, would need to be addressed to ensure the framework functions reliably and efficiently as intended. The focus management also needs a more robust, centralized implementation.

With these fixes, this could be a very powerful and unique PowerShell TUI framework.
