# JSON Serialization Warning Fix Summary

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Summary of the JSON serialization depth warning fix for Axiom-Phoenix v4.0

.DESCRIPTION
    When pressing Ctrl+P to open the Command Palette, you were getting:
    "WARNING: Resulting JSON is truncated as serialization has exceeded the set depth of 10"

.ROOT CAUSE
    The warning was caused by PowerShell attempting to serialize objects with circular references:
    
    1. UIElement objects have Parent/Children relationships creating circular references
    2. The Write-Log function was using ConvertTo-Json with -Depth 10
    3. When logging objects containing UIElements, it hit the depth limit
    4. The CommandPalette contains Panel, TextBox, and ListBox (all UIElements)

.FIXES APPLIED
    1. Modified Write-Log function in AllFunctions.ps1:
       - Added special handling for UIElement objects
       - Reduced JSON depth to 3 and added error handling
       - Falls back to simple string representation on serialization failure

    2. Fixed Logger.LogException in AllServices.ps1:
       - Added try-catch around ConvertTo-Json
       - Falls back to simple string on serialization failure

    3. Added Out-Null to collection operations:
       - $global:TuiState.OverlayStack.Add/Remove operations
       - Prevents accidental object output to pipeline

    4. Created run-axiom-phoenix.ps1 wrapper:
       - Suppresses warning output as additional safety

.TESTING
    Run: .\test-command-palette.ps1
    This will apply fixes and test the application

.FILES MODIFIED
    - AllFunctions.ps1 (Write-Log function)
    - AllServices.ps1 (Logger.LogException method)  
    - AllComponents.ps1 (OverlayStack operations)

.FILES CREATED
    - fix-all-json-issues.ps1 (Main fix script)
    - test-command-palette.ps1 (Test script)
    - run-axiom-phoenix.ps1 (Runtime wrapper)

JSON Serialization Warning Fix - Summary
========================================

The Issue:
----------
When pressing Ctrl+P, PowerShell was trying to serialize UIElement objects
that have circular parent-child references, causing depth limit warnings.

The Solution:
-------------
1. Modified logging to detect UIElement objects and use simple representations
2. Added error handling around all JSON serialization  
3. Reduced serialization depth from 10 to 3
4. Added defensive Out-Null statements

To Apply Fixes:
---------------
Run: .\fix-all-json-issues.ps1

To Test:
--------
Run: .\test-command-palette.ps1

The warning should no longer appear when using Ctrl+P!
