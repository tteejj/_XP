# AXIOM-PHOENIX JSON TRUNCATION WARNING - FIXED!

## THE ACTUAL ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED:

The JSON truncation warning was coming from **Start.ps1** line 271:
```powershell
$dataManager.AddTask($task) | Out-Null
```

## WHY IT HAPPENED:

1. The `AddTask` method returns a `PmcTask` object
2. PowerShell was trying to serialize this object before sending it to `Out-Null`
3. The task objects have deep nesting and circular references
4. This exceeded even the increased depth limit of 10

## THE FIX:

Changed line 271 in Start.ps1 from:
```powershell
$dataManager.AddTask($task) | Out-Null
```

To:
```powershell
[void]$dataManager.AddTask($task)
```

## WHAT THIS DOES:

- `[void]` cast discards the return value WITHOUT any serialization
- No pipeline operation means no JSON conversion attempt
- Much more efficient than piping to Out-Null

## OTHER FIXES APPLIED:

1. **AllFunctions.ps1** - Write-Log function: Increased depth from 3 to 10
2. **AllServices.ps1** - Logger.LogException: Increased depth from 3 to 10

## TO RUN THE FIXED APPLICATION:

```powershell
.\Start.ps1
```

The JSON truncation warning should no longer appear!
