# FIXES APPLIED TO AXIOM-PHOENIX MONO v4.0

## Issues Fixed:

1. **CommandPalette Initialization Error**
   - Fixed constructor call to use correct parameters: `[CommandPalette]::new(name, actionService)`
   - Moved CommandPalette creation AFTER engine initialization
   - Added proper centering of CommandPalette

2. **Screen Not Displaying**
   - Fixed screen resize to happen BEFORE Initialize() is called
   - This ensures panels are created with correct dimensions
   - Added debug output to track screen initialization

3. **Rendering Pipeline Issues**
   - Fixed Write-TuiBox function to use $ForegroundColor instead of undefined $BorderColor
   - Added debug rendering to verify the rendering pipeline is working
   - Added test output on first frame to confirm rendering

4. **Input Processing**
   - Added comprehensive error handling to key processing
   - Added visible feedback when keys are pressed (Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Q)
   - Fixed command palette visibility toggle

5. **Engine Initialization Order**
   - Initialize-TuiEngine is now called BEFORE creating UI components
   - This ensures buffers exist when components are created
   - ScreenStack is verified after engine initialization

## To Run:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\jhnhe\Documents\GitHub\_XP\_mono"
.\Start.ps1
```

## Expected Behavior:
- Console should show initialization messages
- "AXIOM-PHOENIX IS RUNNING!" should appear on first frame
- Dashboard should display with three panels: Task Summary, Quick Start, System Status
- Ctrl+P should open Command Palette
- Ctrl+Q should exit the application

## Debug Features Added:
- Frame counter display on first render
- Key action logging when global hotkeys are pressed
- Screen initialization size logging
- Error messages for rendering failures
