# Axiom-Phoenix v4.0 Window Model Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete True Windowing Model and fixed the CommandPalette action execution issue.

## Major Changes

### 1. **True Windowing Model**
- **Screen Base Class**: Added `IsOverlay` property to distinguish overlay windows
- **NavigationService**: Enhanced with `GetWindows()` method and focus state management
- **FocusManager**: Added focus stack with `PushFocusState()` and `PopFocusState()`
- **Render System**: Updated to render all windows in the stack (bottom-to-top)
- **ScrollablePanel**: Simplified to use direct viewport clipping
- **DialogManager**: Converted to a facade over NavigationService

### 2. **CommandPalette Fix**
- **Root Cause**: Deferred action queue was using script-scoped variable inaccessible from event handler
- **Solution**: Moved queue to `$global:TuiState.DeferredActions`
- **Added**: Extensive debug logging throughout the action execution flow
- **Test Action**: Added `test.simple` action to verify execution

### 3. **PowerShell 5.1 Compatibility**
- **Issue**: Null-conditional operators (`?.` and `??`) only work in PowerShell 7.0+
- **Fixed**: Replaced all instances with compatible conditional checks

## Files Modified

### Base Classes
- `Base/ABC.006_Screen.ps1` - Added IsOverlay property
- `Base/ABC.004_UIElement.ps1` - No changes (reference only)

### Services
- `Services/ASE.008_NavigationService.ps1` - Added GetWindows() and focus hooks
- `Services/ASE.006_FocusManager.ps1` - Added focus stack and fixed null-conditional operators
- `Services/ASE.004_ActionService.ps1` - Fixed page marker, added test action
- `Services/ASE.001_Logger.ps1` - Added environment variable support for log level

### Components
- `Components/ACO.016_CommandPalette.ps1` - Added debug logging
- `Components/ACO.014a_Dialog.ps1` - Fixed null-conditional operators, added logging
- `Components/ACO.012_ScrollablePanel.ps1` - Simplified rendering without virtual buffer

### Runtime
- `Runtime/ART.003_RenderingSystem.ps1` - Updated to render window stack
- `Runtime/ART.002_EngineManagement.ps1` - Fixed deferred action system

## New Files Created

### Documentation
- `WINDOW_MODEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed window model documentation
- `COMMANDPALETTE_FIX.md` - CommandPalette fix documentation
- `POWERSHELL_COMPATIBILITY_FIXES.md` - PowerShell version compatibility notes

### Test Scripts
- `Test-WindowModel.ps1` - Comprehensive window model test
- `Test-CommandPalette.ps1` - CommandPalette test instructions
- `Debug-CommandPalette.ps1` - Debug script for action execution
- `Debug-Helper.ps1` - Helper script with log viewing
- `Start-Debug.ps1` - Quick debug launcher
- `Check-PowerShellVersion.ps1` - Version compatibility checker

## Key Improvements

1. **Unified Architecture**: All windows (screens and dialogs) use the same navigation system
2. **Automatic Focus Management**: Focus is preserved and restored when navigating
3. **True Modal Behavior**: Only the top window receives input
4. **Improved Performance**: Removed complex virtual buffer management
5. **Better Debugging**: Environment-based log level control
6. **PowerShell Compatibility**: Works with PowerShell 5.1+

## Testing

To test the CommandPalette fix:
```powershell
# Enable debug logging
$env:AXIOM_LOG_LEVEL = "Debug"

# Run the application
./Start.ps1

# Test steps:
# 1. Press Ctrl+P to open Command Palette
# 2. Select "test.simple" action
# 3. Press Enter
# 4. Dashboard should refresh (action executed)

# Check logs at:
Join-Path $env:TEMP "axiom-phoenix.log"
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Add window transition animations
2. Implement window constraints (min/max size)
3. Add non-modal dialog support if needed
4. Enhanced transparency effects for overlays
5. Performance profiling and optimization

The framework now has a robust window model and fully functional CommandPalette that can execute any registered action.
