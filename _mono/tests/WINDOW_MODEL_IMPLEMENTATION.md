# True Windowing Model Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete True Windowing Model for Axiom-Phoenix v4.0, transforming the framework from a hybrid overlay/navigation system to a pure window-stack based architecture.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Screen Base Class Enhancement**
- Added `IsOverlay` property to Screen class (default false)
- Dialogs set this to true to indicate overlay rendering behavior

### 2. **NavigationService Window Stack**
- Added `GetWindows()` method to expose the full navigation stack
- Returns array with bottom window at index 0, top window at end
- Added focus management hooks:
  - `NavigateTo()`: Calls `FocusManager.PushFocusState()` for overlays
  - `GoBack()`: Calls `FocusManager.PopFocusState()` when leaving overlays

### 3. **FocusManager Context Stack**
- Added `FocusStack` property to maintain focus history
- New methods:
  - `PushFocusState()`: Saves current focus when entering overlay
  - `PopFocusState()`: Restores focus when exiting overlay
- Stack cleared on cleanup

### 4. **Render System Stack-Aware**
- Modified `Invoke-TuiRender` to render all windows in stack
- Bottom-to-top rendering for proper layering
- Overlay windows can have transparency effects
- Each window maintains its own buffer

### 5. **ScrollablePanel Simplification**
- Removed complex virtual buffer approach
- Direct viewport clipping during render
- Children rendered only if visible in viewport
- Improved performance and reduced memory usage

### 6. **TextBox Wrapper**
- Already existed with proper `OnResize` override
- Ensures inner TextBoxComponent resizes correctly

### 7. **DialogManager as Facade**
- Simplified to use NavigationService
- `ShowDialog()`: Just calls `NavigateTo()`
- `HideDialog()`: Deprecated, dialogs use `Complete()`
- No internal state management needed

### 8. **CommandPalette Integration**
- Updated `app.commandPalette` action to use CommandPalette directly
- CommandPalette inherits from Dialog (which inherits from Screen)
- Uses `OnClose` callback for action execution
- Deferred action system prevents re-entrance issues

### 9. **Deferred Action System**
- Added to engine loop to handle post-dialog actions
- Uses EventManager to queue actions
- Processes one deferred action per frame
- Prevents stack corruption from re-entrant navigation

### 10. **Input Model Clarity**
- Input only goes to the top window (CurrentScreen)
- No complex overlay routing needed
- Modal behavior is automatic

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Architectural Clarity**
   - Single, consistent window model
   - No distinction between screens and dialogs at the framework level
   - Clear ownership of focus and input

2. **Simplified Code**
   - Removed overlay-specific logic
   - Cleaner navigation flow
   - Less state to manage

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Focus automatically restored when closing dialogs
   - Consistent navigation behavior
   - Proper modal semantics

4. **Performance Improvements**
   - ScrollablePanel no longer maintains large virtual buffers
   - Efficient viewport-based rendering
   - Reduced memory footprint

5. **Maintainability**
   - Fewer edge cases to handle
   - Consistent patterns throughout
   - Easier to debug navigation issues

## Testing
Created comprehensive test script (`Test-WindowModel.ps1`) that verifies:
- Window stack management
- Focus preservation and restoration
- Dialog navigation
- CommandPalette as dialog
- Render system with multiple windows
- ScrollablePanel without virtual buffers

## Migration Notes
For existing code:
- Dialogs should inherit from Dialog class (which inherits from Screen)
- Use `dialog.Complete(result)` instead of manual navigation
- CommandPaletteScreen can be removed (use CommandPalette directly)
- Update any direct overlay manipulation to use NavigationService

## Future Enhancements
- Add window transition animations
- Implement window position/size constraints
- Add non-modal dialog support (if needed)
- Enhanced transparency/blur effects for overlays

The True Windowing Model is now fully implemented and provides a robust foundation for complex TUI applications.
