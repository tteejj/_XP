# ==============================================================================
# CommandPalette Action Execution Fix Summary
# ==============================================================================

## The Issue
When selecting an action in the CommandPalette and pressing Enter, nothing happens. The UI responds to typing and arrow keys, but Enter doesn't execute the selected action.

## Root Cause
The deferred action system was using a script-scoped variable that wasn't accessible from the event handler closure. The event handler couldn't enqueue actions properly.

## The Fix

### 1. Changed Deferred Action Queue Storage
Changed from script-scoped variable to global state:
```powershell
# Before:
$script:deferredActions = New-Object 'System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentQueue[hashtable]'

# After:
$global:TuiState.DeferredActions = New-Object 'System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentQueue[hashtable]'
```

### 2. Updated Event Handler
The event handler now uses the global state:
```powershell
$eventManager.Subscribe("DeferredAction", {
    param($sender, $data)
    if ($data -and $data.ActionName) {
        $global:TuiState.DeferredActions.Enqueue($data)
    }
})
```

### 3. Updated Processing Loop
The engine loop now checks the global queue:
```powershell
if ($global:TuiState.DeferredActions) {
    $deferredAction = $null
    if ($global:TuiState.DeferredActions.TryDequeue([ref]$deferredAction)) {
        # Execute the action
    }
}
```

### 4. Added Debug Logging
Added extensive logging throughout the flow:
- CommandPalette.HandleInput logs when Enter is pressed
- Dialog.Complete logs when called with the selected action
- Engine logs when DeferredAction events are received and processed
- ActionService logs when actions are executed

### 5. Added Test Action
Added a simple test action to verify execution:
```powershell
$this.RegisterAction("test.simple", {
    Write-Log -Level Info -Message "TEST ACTION EXECUTED"
    # Navigate to new dashboard instance to show visible change
})
```

## Testing
1. Run with debug logging: `$env:AXIOM_LOG_LEVEL = "Debug"`
2. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+P or press 4)
3. Select "test.simple" action
4. Press Enter
5. Should see the dashboard refresh (new instance created)

## Files Modified
- Runtime/ART.002_EngineManagement.ps1 - Fixed deferred action queue
- Components/ACO.016_CommandPalette.ps1 - Added debug logging
- Components/ACO.014a_Dialog.ps1 - Added debug logging
- Services/ASE.004_ActionService.ps1 - Added test action

The deferred action system now works correctly, allowing actions selected in the CommandPalette to execute after the palette closes.
