# CommandPalette Visual Artifacts Fix Summary

## Problem
1. CommandPalette was not closing properly after selecting an action
2. Visual artifacts appeared on the screen (duplicated buttons)
3. The screen was not responding to input after using CommandPalette
4. Selected actions were not executing due to timing issues

## Root Cause
The CommandPalette uses a deferred action pattern to avoid re-entrance issues during window navigation. However:
- The dialog wasn't being hidden before navigation
- The deferred action was executing too quickly, before the screen was fully cleared
- The CommandPalette wasn't properly cleaning up its state

## Fixes Applied

### 1. CommandPalette Component (ACO.016_CommandPalette.ps1)
- Added override of `Complete()` method
- Calls `Cleanup()` to clear internal state before completion
- Forces a screen redraw before calling parent's Complete method

### 2. Dialog Base Class (ACO.014a_Dialog.ps1)
- Modified `Complete()` to set `Visible = $false` immediately
- Forces screen redraw before navigation
- Ensures dialog is hidden before calling OnClose callback

### 3. Engine Deferred Action Processing (ART.002_EngineManagement.ps1)
- Added 2-frame delay before executing deferred actions
- Ensures dialog is fully removed from screen before action executes
- Prevents visual artifacts from lingering during action execution

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Run `.\Start.ps1`
2. Press Ctrl+P to open CommandPalette
3. Select any action (e.g., "Go to Task List")
4. Verify:
   - Dialog closes cleanly without artifacts
   - Selected action executes properly
   - Screen responds to input after action

## Technical Details
The fix implements a proper cleanup sequence:
1. User selects action â†’ CommandPalette.Complete() called
2. CommandPalette cleans up state and requests redraw
3. Dialog hides itself and forces screen update
4. Navigation occurs (GoBack to previous screen)
5. Engine waits 2 frames for rendering to complete
6. Deferred action executes on clean screen

This ensures visual artifacts are cleared before the action runs, preventing the issues seen in the logs.
