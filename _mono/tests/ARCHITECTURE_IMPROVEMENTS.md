# ServiceContainer Architecture Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the architectural improvements made to the Axiom-Phoenix v4.0 framework to properly implement the ServiceContainer pattern, removing tight coupling and improving maintainability.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. NavigationService Refactoring

**Before:**
```powershell
class NavigationService {
    [EventManager]$EventManager
    [hashtable]$Services
    
    NavigationService([hashtable]$services) {
        $this.Services = $services
        $this.EventManager = $services.EventManager
    }
}
```

**After:**
```powershell
class NavigationService {
    [ServiceContainer]$ServiceContainer
    
    NavigationService([ServiceContainer]$serviceContainer) {
        $this.ServiceContainer = $serviceContainer
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Removes tight coupling to specific services
- NavigationService no longer needs to know about EventManager upfront
- Services are requested only when needed using `$this.ServiceContainer.GetService()`

### 2. Screen Base Class Improvements

**Before:**
- Had two constructors: one taking hashtable, one taking ServiceContainer
- The ServiceContainer constructor still created and maintained a Services hashtable
- Mixed patterns caused confusion

**After:**
- Primary constructor takes ServiceContainer directly
- Legacy hashtable constructor marked as deprecated
- All service access goes through ServiceContainer
- Cleaner, more consistent pattern

### 3. Service Registration Simplification

**Before (Start.ps1):**
```powershell
$container.RegisterFactory("NavigationService", {
    param($c)
    $services = @{
        EventManager = $c.GetService("EventManager")
        ThemeManager = $c.GetService("ThemeManager")
        DataManager = $c.GetService("DataManager")
        # ... manually wire all dependencies
    }
    return [NavigationService]::new($services)
})
```

**After (Start.ps1):**
```powershell
$container.Register("NavigationService", [NavigationService]::new($container))
```

**Benefits:**
- Dramatically simpler registration
- No manual dependency wiring
- NavigationService manages its own dependencies

## Architectural Benefits

### 1. **Loose Coupling**
- Services no longer need to know about each other at construction time
- Dependencies are resolved only when needed
- Adding new service dependencies doesn't require changes to initialization code

### 2. **Improved Scalability**
- Adding a new service to NavigationService only requires changing NavigationService itself
- No changes needed in Start.ps1 or other initialization code
- Follows Open/Closed Principle

### 3. **Better Testability**
- Services can be easily mocked by providing a test ServiceContainer
- No need to create complex hashtable structures for testing
- Clear dependency injection pattern

### 4. **Consistent Pattern**
- All services follow the same pattern for dependency resolution
- Reduces cognitive load for developers
- Makes the codebase more predictable

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`Test-ServiceContainer.ps1`) has been created to verify:
- ServiceContainer can be created and services registered
- NavigationService correctly uses ServiceContainer
- Screen classes can access services through ServiceContainer
- No regression in functionality

## Migration Guide

For any custom screens or services:

1. **Update Service Constructors:**
   ```powershell
   # Old
   MyService([hashtable]$services)
   
   # New
   MyService([ServiceContainer]$container)
   ```

2. **Update Service Access:**
   ```powershell
   # Old
   $this.Services.EventManager
   
   # New
   $this.ServiceContainer.GetService("EventManager")
   ```

3. **Update Service Registration:**
   ```powershell
   # Old - complex factory with manual wiring
   # New - simple direct registration
   $container.Register("MyService", [MyService]::new($container))
   ```

## Conclusion

These architectural improvements align with industry best practices for dependency injection and inversion of control. The framework is now more maintainable, scalable, and follows SOLID principles more closely.

The changes maintain backward compatibility where possible (deprecated constructors) while providing a clear path forward for new development.
